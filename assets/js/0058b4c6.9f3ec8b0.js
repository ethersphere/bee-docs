Instead of a flat list of uploaded files, Bee encodes directory structure as a compact prefix trie. This allows URLs like /images/logo.png, /docs/readme.txt, or / to resolve efficiently to the correct Swarm references. Whenever you upload a directory \u2014 via /bzz, bee-js, or swarm-cli \u2014 Bee automatically creates and uploads a manifest that enables a filesystem-like layer inside Swarm. The manifest reference itself is the root reference for your uploaded directory.","sidebar":"develop"},"develop/tools-and-features/pinning":{"id":"develop/tools-and-features/pinning","title":"Pinning","description":"Each Bee node is configured to reserve a certain amount of memory on your computer\'s hard drive to store and serve chunks within their neighborhood of responsibility for other nodes in the Swarm network. Once this alloted space has been filled, each Bee node deletes older chunks to make way for newer ones as they are uploaded by the network.","sidebar":"develop"},"develop/tools-and-features/pss":{"id":"develop/tools-and-features/pss","title":"PSS Messaging","description":"Out of the ashes of Ethereum\'s vision for a leak-proof decentralised anonymous messaging system - Whisper - comes PSS (or BZZ, whispered! \ud83e\udd2b).
