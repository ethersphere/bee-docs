title: SWAP Bandwidth Accounting
id: swap
---

Underpinning Swarm is a set of accounting protocols that have been developed and prototyped during over 5 years of R&D. Your Beta Bee node contains functionality giving it the ability to keep track of bandwidth exchanges with all it's peers, issue and cache cheques using smart contracts which live on EVM compatible blockchain. Currently we are in the testing phase using the Goerli testnet. We would love for you to get involved, help us try out these incentives and maybe even earn some gBZZ!

Learn more about how SWAP and the other accounting protocols work by reading the [Book of Swarm](https://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/latest.bookofswarm.eth/the-book-of-swarm.pdf).

To investigate our accounting, let's upload a 20mb file to the network so we can see some traffic being generated as Bee begins to push chunks into the network. In order to do this, we will pay a forwarding cost in each node that passes the chunk on.

First, we will need to run our Bee node with a RPC endpoint, debug api enabled and verbosity set to TRACE.

```sh
bee start \
  --verbosity 5 \
  --swap-enable \
  --swap-endpoint https://rpc.slock.it/goerli \
  --debug-api-enable
```

```sh
dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/test.txt bs=1m count=20
curl -F file=@/tmp/test.txt http://localhost:8080/files
```

If we set `--verbosity 5` in our Bee configuration, we will be able to see these individual transactions being recorded on our node's internal per peer ledgers.

We also have a rich set of features to be able to query the current accounting state of your node. For example, you may query your node's current balance by send a POST request to the balances endpoint.

```sh
curl localhost:6060/chequebook/balance | jq
```

```json
{
  "totalBalance": 10000000,
  "availableBalance": 9640360
}
```

It is also possible to examine per-peer balances.

```sh
curl localhost:6060/balances | jq
```

```json
{
  "balances": [
    //...
    {
      "peer": "d0bf001e05014fa036af97f3d226bee253d2b147f540b6c2210947e5b7b409af",
      "balance": -85420
    },
    {
      "peer": "f1e2872581de18bdc68060dc8edd3aa96368eb341e915aba86b450486b105a47",
      "balance": -75990
    }
    //...
  ]
}
```

In Swarm, these per-peer balances simply represent trustful agreements between nodes. Tokens only actually change hands when a node settles a cheque. This can either be triggered manually or when a certain threshold is reached with a peer. In this case, a settlement takes place. You may view these using the settlements endpoint.

```sh
curl localhost:6060/settlements | jq
```

```json
{
  "totalreceived": 0,
  "totalsent": 359640,
  "settlements": [
    // ...
    {
      "peer": "d0bf001e05014fa036af97f3d226bee253d2b147f540b6c2210947e5b7b409af",
      "received": 0,
      "sent": 90070
    },
    {
      "peer": "f1e2872581de18bdc68060dc8edd3aa96368eb341e915aba86b450486b105a47",
      "received": 89890,
      "sent": 0
    }
    // ...
  ]
}
```

More info can be found by using the chequebook api.

```sh
curl localhost:6060/chequebook/cheque | jq
```

```json
{
  "totalreceived": 0,
  "totalsent": 718030,
  "settlements": [
    //...
    {
      "peer": "dce1833609db868e7611145b48224c061ea57fd14e784a278f2469f355292ca6",
      "received": 0,
      "sent": 89550
    }
    //...
  ]
}
```

As our node's participation in the network increases, we will begin to see more and more of these balances arriving. In the case that we have *received* a settlement from another peer, we can ask our node to perform the relevant transactions on the blockchain, and cash our earnings out.

To do this, we simply POST the relevant peer's address to the `cashout` endpoint.

```sh
curl -XPOST http://localhost:6060/chequebook/cashout/d7881307e793e389642ea733451db368c4c9b9e23f188cca659c8674d183a56b
```

```json
{"transactionHash":"0xba7b500e21fc0dc0d7163c13bb5fea235d4eb769d342e9c007f51ab8512a9a82"}
```

You may check the status of your transaction using [Goerli Etherscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/)

Finally, we can now see the status of the cashout transaction by sending a GET request to the same URL.

```sh
curl http://localhost:6060/chequebook/cashout/d7881307e793e389642ea733451db368c4c9b9e23f188cca659c8674d183a56b | jq
```

```json
{
  "peer": "d7881307e793e389642ea733451db368c4c9b9e23f188cca659c8674d183a56b",
  "chequebook": "0xae315a9adf0920ba4f3353e2f011031ca701d247",
  "cumulativePayout": 179160,
  "beneficiary": "0x21b26864067deb88e2d5cdca512167815f2910d3",
  "transactionHash": "0xba7b500e21fc0dc0d7163c13bb5fea235d4eb769d342e9c007f51ab8512a9a82",
  "result": {
    "recipient": "0x312fe7fde9e0768337c9b3e3462189ea6f9f9066",
    "lastPayout": 179160,
    "bounced": false
  }
}
```

Success, we earned our first gBZZ! üêù
