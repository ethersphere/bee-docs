# Docker Install

The following is a guide for installing a Bee node using Docker. Docker images for Bee are hosted at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethersphere/bee). Using Docker to operate your Bee node offers many benefits, such as ease of deployment and consistency across environments. 

:::caution
In the examples below we specify the exact image version as 2.6.0. It's recommended to only use the exact version number tags. Make sure to check that you're on the latest version of Bee by reviewing the tags for Bee on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethersphere/bee/tags), and replace 2.6.0 in the commands below if there is a newer full release. 
:::

:::warning
Note that in all the examples below we map the Bee API to 127.0.0.1 (localhost), since we do not want to expose our Bee API endpoint to the public internet, as that would allow anyone to control our node. Make sure you do the same, and it's also recommended to use a  firewall to protect access to your node(s).
:::

:::info
This guide sets options using environment variables as part of the Docker startup commands such as `-e BEE_API_ADDR=":1633"`, however there are [several other methods available for configuring options](/docs/bee/working-with-bee/configuration). 
:::


## Node setup process 

This section will guide you through setting up and running a single full Bee node using Docker. In the guide, we use a single line command for running our Bee node, with the Bee config options being set through environment variables, and a single volume hosted for our node's data. 


### Start node

```bash
docker run -d --name bee-1 \
  --restart always \
  -p 127.0.0.1:1633:1633 \
  -p 1634:1634 \
  -e BEE_API_ADDR=":1633" \
  -e BEE_FULL_NODE="true" \
  -e BEE_SWAP_ENABLE="true" \
  -e BEE_PASSWORD="flummoxedgranitecarrot" \
  -e BEE_BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_ENDPOINT="https://xdai.fairdatasociety.org" \
  -v bee-1:/home/bee/.bee \
  ethersphere/bee:2.6.0 start
```

Here is the same command in a single line in case you run into issues with the line breaks in the command above:

```bash
docker run -d --name bee-1 --restart always -p 127.0.0.1:1633:1633 -p 1634:1634 -e BEE_API_ADDR=":1633" -e BEE_FULL_NODE="true" -e BEE_SWAP_ENABLE="true" -e BEE_PASSWORD="flummoxedgranitecarrot" -e BEE_BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_ENDPOINT="https://xdai.fairdatasociety.org" -v bee-1:/home/bee/.bee ethersphere/bee:2.6.0 start
```

#### Command explained:

- **`-d`**: Runs the container in the background.
- **`--restart always`**: Sets the [restart policy](https://docs.docker.com/engine/containers/start-containers-automatically/) for the container to `always`.
- **`--name bee-1`**: Names the container `bee-1`.
- **`-p 127.0.0.1:1633:1633`**: Exposes the API on port 1633, only accessible locally.
- **`-p 1634:1634`**: Exposes the P2P port 1634 to the public.
- **`-e BEE_API_ADDR=":1633"`**: Sets the Bee API to use port 1633.
- **`-e BEE_FULL_NODE="true"`**: Runs as a full node.
- **`-e BEE_SWAP_ENABLE="true"`**: Enables the SWAP protocol for payments.
- **`-e BEE_PASSWORD="flummoxedgranitecarrot"`**: Sets the keystore password, make sure to replace with your own.
- **`-e BEE_BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_ENDPOINT="https://xdai.fairdatasociety.org"`**: Connects to the Gnosis Chain.
- **`-v bee-1:/home/bee/.bee`**: Persists node data in the `bee-1` volume.
- **`ethersphere/bee:2.6.0 start`**: Runs Bee version 2.6.0 and starts the node.

This setup runs the Bee node in a container, with full node functionality, SWAP enabled, and connections to the Gnosis blockchain for chequebook and postage stamp management, while persisting its data using a volume. 

:::info
We have included the password directly in the start command as an environment variable with `-e BEE_PASSWORD="flummoxedgranitecarrot"`. You may wish to use a password file instead, which can be set with the `BEE_PASSWORD_FILE` command. However this will likely require some modifications on your host machine, the details of which will vary from system to system.
:::

```bash
docker ps
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your Bee node listed:

```bash
CONTAINER ID     IMAGE     COMMAND     CREATED     STATUS     PORTS     NAMES
37f4ad8b4060   ethersphere/bee:2.6.0   "bee start"   6 seconds ago   Up 5 seconds   127.0.0.1:1633->1633/tcp, 0.0.0.0:1634->1634/tcp, :::1634->1634/tcp   bee-1
```

And check the logs:

```bash
docker logs -f bee-1
```

The output should contain a line which prints a message notifying you of the minimum required xDAI for running a node as well as the address of your node. Copy the address and save it for use in the next section.

```bash
"time"="2024-09-24 22:06:51.363708" "level"="warning" "logger"="node/chequebook" "msg"="cannot continue until there is at least min xDAI (for Gas) available on address" "min_amount"="0.0003576874793" "address"="0x91A7e3AC06020750D32CeffbEeFD55B4c5e42bd6"
```

You can use `Ctrl + C` to exit the logs.

Before moving on to funding, stop your node:

```bash
docker stop bee-1
```

And let's confirm that it has stopped:

```bash
docker ps
```

We can confirm no Docker container processes are currently running.

```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
````

### Fund node

Check the logs from the previous step. Look for the line which says: 

```
"time"="2024-09-24 18:15:34.520716" "level"="info" "logger"="node" "msg"="using ethereum address" "address"="0x1A801dd3ec955E905ca424a85C3423599bfb0E66"
```
That address is your node's address on Gnosis Chain which needs to be funded with xDAI and xBZZ. Copy it and save it for the next step.

xDAI is widely available from many different centralized and decentralized exchanges, just make sure that you are getting xDAI on Gnosis Chain, and not DAI on some other chain. See [this page](https://www.ethswarm.org/get-bzz) for a list of resources for getting xBZZ (again, make certain that you are getting the Gnosis Chain version, and not BZZ on Ethereum).  

After acquiring some xDAI and some xBZZ, send them to the address you copied above.

***How Much to Send?***

Only a very small amount of xDAI is needed to get started, 0.1 is more than enough.
 
You can start with just 2 or 3 xBZZ for uploading small amounts of data, but you will need at least 10 xBZZ if you plan on staking.

### Initialize full node

After you have a small amount of xDAI in your node's Gnosis Chain address, you can now restart your node using the same command as before so that it can issue the required smart contract transactions and also sync data. 

```bash
docker start bee-1
```

Let's check the logs to see what's happening:

```bash
docker logs -f bee-1
```

Your logs should look something like this:

```bash
Welcome to Swarm.... Bzzz Bzzzz Bzzzz
                \     /
            \    o ^ o    /
              \ (     ) /
   ____________(%%%%%%%)____________
  (     /   /  )%%%%%%%(  \   \     )
  (___/___/__/           \__\___\___)
     (     /  /(%%%%%%%)\  \     )
      (__/___/ (%%%%%%%) \___\__)
              /(       )\
            /   (%%%%%)   \
                 (%%%)
                   !

```

Your node will take some time to finish [syncing postage contract data](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/develop/tools-and-features/buy-a-stamp-batch/) as indicated by the final line:

```bash
"msg"="waiting to sync postage contract data, this may take a while... more info available in Debug loglevel"
```

You may need to wait 5 - 10 minutes for your node to finish syncing in this step. 

Eventually you will be able to see when your node finishes syncing, and the logs will indicate your node is starting in full node mode:

```bash
"time"="2024-09-24 22:30:19.154067" "level"="info" "logger"="node" "msg"="starting in full mode"
"time"="2024-09-24 22:30:19.155320" "level"="info" "logger"="node/multiresolver" "msg"="name resolver: no name resolution service provided"
"time"="2024-09-24 22:30:19.341032" "level"="info" "logger"="node/storageincentives" "msg"="entered new phase" "phase"="reveal" "round"=237974 "block"=36172090
"time"="2024-09-24 22:30:33.610825" "level"="info" "logger"="node/kademlia" "msg"="disconnected peer" "peer_address"="6ceb30c7afc11716f866d19b7eeda9836757031ed056b61961e949f6e705b49e"
```

Your node will now begin syncing chunks from the network, this process can take several hours. You check your node's progress with the `/status` endpoint:

```bash
curl -s  http://localhost:1633/status | jq
```

```bash
{
  "overlay": "22dc155fe072e131449ec7ea2f77de16f4735f06257ebaa5daf2fdcf14267fd9",
  "proximity": 256,
  "beeMode": "full",
  "reserveSize": 686217,
  "reserveSizeWithinRadius": 321888,
  "pullsyncRate": 497.8747754074074,
  "storageRadius": 11,
  "connectedPeers": 148,
  "neighborhoodSize": 4,
  "batchCommitment": 74510761984,
  "isReachable": false,
  "lastSyncedBlock": 36172390
}
```
We can see that our node has not yet finished syncing chunks since the `pullsyncRate` is around 497 chunks per second. Once the node is fully synced, this value will go to zero. It can take several hours for syncing to complete, but we do not need to wait until our node is fully synced before staking, so we can move directly to the next step. 

### Stake node

You can use the following command to stake 10 xBZZ:

```bash
curl -XPOST localhost:1633/stake/100000000000000000
```

If the staking transaction is successful a `txHash` will be returned:

```
{"txHash":"0x258d64720fe7abade794f14ef3261534ff823ef3e2e0011c431c31aea75c2dd5"}
```

We can also confirm that our node has been staked with the `/stake` endpoint:

```bash
curl localhost:1633/stake
```

The results will be displayed in PLUR units (1 PLUR is equal to 1e-16 xBZZ). If you have properly staked the minimum 10 xBZZ, you should see the output below:

```bash
{"stakedAmount":"100000000000000000"}
```

Congratulations! You have now installed your Bee node and successfully connected it to the network as a full staking node. Your node will now be in the process of syncing chunks from the network. Once it is fully synced, your node will finally be eligible for earning staking rewards. 

### Set Target Neighborhood

When installing your Bee node it will automatically be assigned a neighborhood. However, when running a full node with staking there are benefits to periodically updating your node's neighborhood. Learn more about why and how to set your node's target neighborhood [here](/docs/bee/installation/set-target-neighborhood).

### Logs and monitoring

Docker provides convenient built-in tools for logging and monitoring your node, which you've already encountered if you've read through earlier sections of this guide. For a more detailed guide, [refer to the section on logging](/docs/bee/working-with-bee/logs-and-files).

**Viewing node logs:**

To monitor your node’s logs in real-time, use the following command:

```bash
docker logs -f bee-1
```

This command will continuously output the logs of your Bee node, helping you track its operations. The `-f` flag ensures that you see new log entries as they are written. Press `Ctrl + C` to stop following the logs.

You can read more about how Docker manages container logs [in their official docs](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/logs/).

**Checking the Node's status with the Bee API**

To check your node's status as a staking node, we can use the `/redistributionstate` endpoint:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:1633/redistributionstate | jq
```

Below is the output for a node which has been running for several days:

```bash
{
  "minimumGasFunds": "11080889201250000",
  "hasSufficientFunds": true,
  "isFrozen": false,
  "isFullySynced": true,
  "phase": "claim",
  "round": 212859,
  "lastWonRound": 207391,
  "lastPlayedRound": 210941,
  "lastFrozenRound": 210942,
  "lastSelectedRound": 212553,
  "lastSampleDuration": 491687776653,
  "block": 32354719,
  "reward": "1804537795127017472",
  "fees": "592679945236926714",
  "isHealthy": true
}
```

For a complete breakdown of this output, check out [this section in the Bee docs](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/bee/working-with-bee/bee-api#redistributionstate).

You can read more other important endpoints for monitoring your Bee node in the [official Bee docs](https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/bee/working-with-bee/bee-api), and you can find complete information about all available endpoints in [the API reference docs](https://docs.ethswarm.org/api/).


**Stopping Your Node**

To gracefully stop your Bee node, use the following command:

```bash
docker stop bee-1
```

Replace `bee-1` with the name of your node if you've given it a different name.



## Back Up Keys

Once your node is up and running, make sure to [back up your keys](/docs/bee/working-with-bee/backups). 

## Getting help

The CLI has documentation built-in. Running `bee` gives you an entry point to the documentation. Running `bee start -h` from within your Docker container or `bee start --help` will tell you how you can configure your Bee node via the command line arguments.

You may also check out the [configuration guide](/docs/bee/working-with-bee/configuration), or simply run your Bee terminal command with the `--help` flag, eg. `bee start --help` or `bee --help`.


## Next Steps to Consider


### Access the Swarm
If you'd like to start uploading or downloading files to Swarm, [start here](/docs/develop/introduction).

### Explore the API
The [Bee API](/docs/bee/working-with-bee/bee-api) is the primary method for interacting with Bee and getting information about Bee. After installing Bee and getting it up and running, it's a good idea to start getting familiar with the API.

### Run a hive! 
If you would like to run a hive of many Bees, check out the [hive operators](/docs/bee/installation/hive) section for information on how to operate and monitor many Bees at once.

### Start building DApps on Swarm
If you would like to start building decentralised applications on Swarm, check out our section for [developing with Bee](/docs/develop/introduction).
