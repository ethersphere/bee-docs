This guide will help you install and run a Bee [light node](/docs/bee/working-with-bee/node-types) using the [shell script](/docs/bee/installation/shell-script-install) install method. After explaining how to install and start the node, the guide then explains how to use the [`swarm-cli` command line tool](/docs/bee/working-with-bee/swarm-cli) to find your node's address, fund your node, and buy a batch of postage stamps. Finally it explains how to upload data using a postage stamp batch and how to download that data.

:::tip
A "light" node can download and upload data from Swarm but does not share its disk space with the network and does not earn rewards. [Learn more](/docs/bee/working-with-bee/node-types). 
:::


## Requirements  

- **Linux or macOS** (The shell script installation method does **not** support Windows natively. Windows users can use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).)  
- [Node.js (v18 or higher)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm (Node Package Manager)](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)  
- [`curl`](https://curl.se/) or [`wget`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) (Check with `curl --version` or `wget --version`)
- [~0.20 xBZZ on Gnosis Chain](/docs/bee/installation/fund-your-node)
- [~0.01 xDAI on Gnosis Chain](/docs/bee/installation/fund-your-node)

:::info
Although `BZZ` is the official symbol of the token on both Ethereum and Gnosis Chain, the term `xBZZ` is widely used by the Swarm community and in documentation to indicate that it is BZZ on Gnosis Chain (not Ethereum).
:::

## Install Bee

Run the shell script using `curl` or `wget`:


:::tip
We specify `TAG=v2.6.0` to indicate which Bee version to install. You can find available versions in the ["releases" section](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee/releases) of the Bee GitHub repo.
:::

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethersphere/bee/master/install.sh | TAG=v2.6.0 bash
```

OR

```bash
wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethersphere/bee/master/install.sh | TAG=v2.6.0 bash
```

Verify installation:

```bash
bee version
```



## Install Swarm-CLI

Requires **Node.js 18+**. Install using **npm**:

```bash
npm install --global @ethersphere/swarm-cli
```

Verify installation:

```bash
swarm-cli --version
```


## Start Your Bee Node

Start Bee with a secure password:

```bash
bee start \
  --password YOUR_SECURE_PASSWORD \
  --verbosity 5 \
  --swap-enable \
  --api-addr 127.0.0.1:1633 \
  --blockchain-rpc-endpoint https://xdai.fairdatasociety.org
```

Example output:

```bash
Welcome to Swarm.... Bzzz Bzzzz Bzzzz

üéâ Congratulations! You've just successfully installed and started your first Bee node üêù!


## Get Your Node‚Äôs Address

The final line of the logs in the previous step lets us know that we need to fund our node to continue, and shows our node's Gnosis chain address. Copy the address and save it for the next step:

```bash
"time"="2025-03-04 11:13:11.723451" "level"="warning" "logger"="node/chequebook" "msg"="cannot continue until there is at least min xDAI (for Gas) available on address" "min_amount"="0.000250000002" "address"="0x003842B26B3dB292Cf84d5969E71c0d1e93F5578"
```

You can also view your node's addresses any time using the `swarm-cli addresses` command:

```bash
swarm-cli addresses
```

Example output:

```bash

## Fund Your Node

Send **xDAI** (to pay for transaction fees on Gnosis Chain) and **xBZZ** (for uploads and staking) to your node‚Äôs Ethereum address on **Gnosis Chain**.

- **xDAI:** 0.01 xDAI is enough to start a light node
- **xBZZ:** 0.20 xBZZ is enough to upload a small amount of data

Learn how to [get xDAI and xBZZ](/docs/bee/installation/fund-your-node#getting-tokens) if you need some.

:::tip
If you wait too long to fund your node it may shut itself down. In that case, simply use the same startup command to start the node again.
:::

## Wait to Sync (~30 Minutes)

After starting and funding a Bee light node for the first time, the node will automatically issue a [transaction](https://gnosisscan.io/tx/0xf8048c4e8020ccef842c9a901e6262e9c06d6f5926ff31bdb7dd9d7274dcf19c) on Gnosis Chain to deploy the node's [chequebook contract](/docs/concepts/incentives/bandwidth-incentives#chequebook-contract).

The node then needs to sync blockchain data before it can buy a postage stamp batch. The process may take ***half an hour or longer*** depending on your RPC provider and network speed.

You can check your node's syncing progress with the `swarm-cli status` command:

```bash
swarm-cli status
```

```bash
Bee
API: http://localhost:1633 [OK]

Total xBZZ: 0.0000000000000000

Staking

```

The `Chainsync` section tells us how many blocks our node has synced so far out of the total Gnosis Chain blocks (and the number after the Œî symbol shows how many blocks still need to be synced):

```bash
Chainsync
Block: 33,515,656 / 38,855,407 (Œî 5,339,751)
```
