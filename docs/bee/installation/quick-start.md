This guide will help you install and run a Bee [light node](/docs/bee/working-with-bee/node-types) using the [shell script](/docs/bee/installation/shell-script-install) install method. After explaining how to install and start the node, the guide then explains how to use the [`swarm-cli` command line tool](/docs/bee/working-with-bee/swarm-cli) to find your node's address, fund your node, and buy a batch of postage stamps. Finally it explains how to upload data using a postage stamp batch and how to download that data.

:::tip
A "light" node can download and upload data from Swarm but does not share its disk space with the network and does not earn rewards. [Learn more](/docs/bee/working-with-bee/node-types). 
:::


## Requirements  

- **Linux or macOS** (The shell script installation method does **not** support Windows natively. Windows users can use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).)  
- [Node.js (v18 or higher)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm (Node Package Manager)](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)  
- [`curl`](https://curl.se/) or [`wget`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) (Check with `curl --version` or `wget --version`)
- [~0.20 xBZZ on Gnosis Chain](/docs/bee/installation/fund-your-node)
- [~0.01 xDAI on Gnosis Chain](/docs/bee/installation/fund-your-node)

:::info
Although `BZZ` is the official symbol of the token on both Ethereum and Gnosis Chain, the term `xBZZ` is widely used by the Swarm community and in documentation to indicate that it is BZZ on Gnosis Chain (not Ethereum).
:::

## Install Bee

Run the shell script using `curl` or `wget`:


:::tip
We specify `TAG=v2.6.0` to indicate which Bee version to install. You can find available versions in the ["releases" section](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee/releases) of the Bee GitHub repo.
:::

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethersphere/bee/master/install.sh | TAG=v2.6.0 bash
```

OR

```bash
wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethersphere/bee/master/install.sh | TAG=v2.6.0 bash
```

Verify installation:

```bash
bee version
```



## Install Swarm-CLI

Requires **Node.js 18+**. Install using **npm**:

```bash
npm install --global @ethersphere/swarm-cli
```

Verify installation:

```bash
swarm-cli --version
```


## Start Your Bee Node

Start Bee with a secure password:

```bash
bee start \
  --password YOUR_SECURE_PASSWORD \
  --verbosity 5 \
  --swap-enable \
  --api-addr 127.0.0.1:1633 \
  --blockchain-rpc-endpoint https://xdai.fairdatasociety.org
```

Example output:

```bash
Welcome to Swarm.... Bzzz Bzzzz Bzzzz

üéâ Congratulations! You've just successfully installed and started your first Bee node üêù!


## Get Your Node‚Äôs Address

The final line of the logs in the previous step lets us know that we need to fund our node to continue, and shows our node's Gnosis chain address. Copy the address and save it for the next step:

```bash
"time"="2025-03-04 11:13:11.723451" "level"="warning" "logger"="node/chequebook" "msg"="cannot continue until there is at least min xDAI (for Gas) available on address" "min_amount"="0.000250000002" "address"="0x003842B26B3dB292Cf84d5969E71c0d1e93F5578"
```

You can also view your node's addresses any time using the `swarm-cli addresses` command:

```bash
swarm-cli addresses
```

Example output:

```bash

```

## Fund Your Node

Send **xDAI** (to pay for transaction fees on Gnosis Chain) and **xBZZ** (for uploads and staking) to your node‚Äôs Ethereum address on **Gnosis Chain**.

- **xDAI:** 0.01 xDAI is enough to start a light node
- **xBZZ:** 0.20 xBZZ is enough to upload a small amount of data

Learn how to [get xDAI and xBZZ](/docs/bee/installation/fund-your-node#getting-tokens) if you need some.

:::tip
If you wait too long to fund your node it may shut itself down. In that case, simply use the same startup command to start the node again.
:::

## Wait to Sync (~30 Minutes)

After starting and funding a Bee light node for the first time, the node will automatically issue a [transaction](https://gnosisscan.io/tx/0xf8048c4e8020ccef842c9a901e6262e9c06d6f5926ff31bdb7dd9d7274dcf19c) on Gnosis Chain to deploy the node's [chequebook contract](/docs/concepts/incentives/bandwidth-incentives#chequebook-contract).

The node then needs to sync blockchain data before it can buy a postage stamp batch. The process may take ***half an hour or longer*** depending on your RPC provider and network speed.

You can check your node's syncing progress with the `swarm-cli status` command:

```bash
swarm-cli status
```

```bash
Bee
API: http://localhost:1633 [OK]
Version: 2.6.0-390a402e
Mode: light

Topology
Connected Peers: 143
Population: 6991
Depth: 11

Wallet
xBZZ: 0.0000000000000000
xDAI: 0.009829728398864856

Chainsync
Block: 33,515,656 / 38,855,407 (Œî 5,339,751)

Chequebook
Available xBZZ: 0.0000000000000000
Total xBZZ: 0.0000000000000000

Staking
Staked xBZZ: 0.0000000000000000
```

The `Chainsync` section tells us how many blocks our node has synced so far out of the total Gnosis Chain blocks (and the number after the Œî symbol shows how many blocks still need to be synced):

```bash
Chainsync
Block: 33,515,656 / 38,855,407 (Œî 5,339,751)
```

Once our node is fully synced, we can move on to buying a batch of postage stamps.

## Buy a Batch of Postage Stamps 

:::tip
If you try to purchase a batch of postage stamps before your node has fully synced, you will get a `503` error:

```bash
ERROR Request failed with status code 503
```
:::

Before uploading, you need a **postage stamp**. [Learn more](/docs/develop/access-the-swarm/buy-a-stamp-batch):

You can purchase a batch of stamps using the `swarm-cli create` command to specify how much data you wish to store and for how long:

```bash
swarm-cli stamp create
```


Example output:

```bash
Please provide the total capacity of the postage stamp batch
This represents the total size of data that can be uploaded
Example: 1GB

Please provide the time-to-live (TTL) of the postage stamps
Defines the duration after which the stamp will expire
Example: 1d, 1w, 1month
```

After running the command, you will be asked to specify how much data you wish to store and for how long. In our example we specified one day using `1d` and one gigabyte using `1gb`. The script then parses our input and chooses a ["depth" and "amount"](/docs/develop/access-the-swarm/buy-a-stamp-batch#setting-stamp-batch-parameters-and-options) for our batch, gives as an estimated cost, and prompts us to confirm if we wish to continue or not:

:::tip
The `amount` value determines how long your batch stays a live, while the `depth` value determines how much data it can store. There is a minimum depth of 17 and the `amount` value must be high enough for a batch with at least 24 hours of TTL (time to live). [Learn more](/docs/develop/access-the-swarm/buy-a-stamp-batch#setting-stamp-batch-parameters-and-options).
:::

```bash
You have provided the following parameters:
Capacity: 1.000 GB
TTL: 24 hours

Your parameters are now converted to Swarm's internal parameters:
Depth (capacity): 18
Amount (TTL): 581056344

Estimated cost: 0.015 xBZZ
Estimated capacity: 1.000 GB
Estimated TTL: 24 hours
Type: Immutable
? Confirm the purchase (Y/n)
```

:::info
The capacity and TTL are shown as estimates since the actual capacity and TTL are not deterministic. This is because of Swarm's [dynamic pricing model](/docs/concepts/incentives/price-oracle) and stamp batch [utilization mechanics](/docs/concepts/incentives/postage-stamps#batch-utilisation). 
:::

We input `Y` to confirm our purchase, and then we wait a few moments for the script to issue a transaction on Gnosis Chain to purchase our batch. Finally the script will return a `Stamp ID`, which is the unique identifier for our postage stamp batch.

```bash
? Confirm the purchase Yes
Stamp ID: 0f473645b8444eb75e647bee4ee5d51ad11b94c32a31a0e80729d16eee07b428
```

## Upload a File

After purchasing a batch of postage stamps, we're ready to upload to Swarm. First create a sample file to upload. Open it with your text editor of choice and write a message:

```bash
vi test.txt
cat test.txt
```

```bash
Hello Swarm!
```

After saving your test file, use the `swarm-cli upload` command to upload your file:

```bash
swarm-cli upload test.txt
```

Then we will be prompted to choose a stamp batch ID, we only have a single batch so we just hit "Enter" to continue:

```bash
? Please select a stamp for this action (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ 0f473645b8444eb75e647bee4ee5d51ad11b94c32a31a0e80729d16eee07b428 256.000 MB remaining, TTL 24 hours
```


Response:

```
Swarm hash: cb8fbcc7bc0901afa2cec86590c09b491206af40fc6781874abfc3edc7aa495f
URL: http://localhost:1633/bzz/cb8fbcc7bc0901afa2cec86590c09b491206af40fc6781874abfc3edc7aa495f/
Stamp ID: 8d60f9c2
Usage: 50%
Capacity (immutable): 256.000 MB remaining out of 512.000 MB
```

The "Swarm hash" returned here is the unique reference for our upload.

You can share this hash with someone else and they can use it to download whatever you uploaded for as long as the stamp batch you used still has remaining TTL. 

## Download a File

Use the `swarm-cli download` command with the hash for our uploaded file to download it. We specify the output as the second argument, after the postage stamp hash, using "./" to ensure the file is downloaded into our current directory (otherwise it will create a new directory with the hash itself as the filename and the `test.txt` file we uploaded inside that directory):  

```bash
swarm-cli download cb8fbcc7bc0901afa2cec86590c09b491206af40fc6781874abfc3edc7aa495f ./
```
Output after a successful download: 
```bash
test.txt OK
```

Check the file contents:
```bash
cat test.txt
```

```bash
Hello Swarm!
```
