Swarm CLI is a command line based application built using the [bee-js](/docs/develop/tools-and-features/bee-js/) library which greatly simplifies interactions with the [Bee API](/docs/bee/working-with-bee/bee-api). It is the preferred method for interacting with Bee from the command line and supports almost all common use cases.   

For installation and usage instructions, [see the README](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm-cli/blob/master/README.md).

To check the latest version, see the Swarm CLI [releases page](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm-cli/releases).
