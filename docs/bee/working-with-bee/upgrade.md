It's very important to keep Bee up to date to benefit from security updates and ensure you are able to properly interact with the Swarm network. The [#node-operators](https://discord.com/channels/799027393297514537/811553590170353685) channel is an excellent resource for any of your questions regarding node operation. 

:::warning
Bee sure to [back up](/docs/bee/working-with-bee/backups) your keys and [cash out your cheques](/docs/bee/working-with-bee/cashing-out) to ensure your xBZZ is safe before applying updates.

:::warning
Nodes should not be shut down or updated in the middle of a round they are playing in as it may cause them to lose out on winnings or become frozen. To see if your node is playing the current round, check if `lastPlayedRound` equals `round` in the output from the [`/redistributionstate` endpoint](/api/#tag/RedistributionState/paths/~1redistributionstate/get). See [staking section](/docs/bee/working-with-bee/staking/) for more information on staking and troubleshooting.
