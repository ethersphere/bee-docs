Swarm is a peer-to-peer network of Bee nodes that collectively provide censorship-resistant decentralised storage and communication services. Swarm's mission is to enable a self-sovereign global society and permissionless open markets by providing scalable decentralized storage infrastructure for Web3. Its incentive system is enforced through smart contracts on the Gnosis Chain blockchain and powered by the xBZZ token, making it economically self-sustaining. 

## Bee Client

Bee is a Swarm client implemented in Go and serves as the foundation of the Swarm network. Bee nodes form a private, decentralized, and self-sustaining network for permissionless publishing and data storage. You can learn more about how Bee clients work by reading about the [concepts and protocols](/docs/concepts/what-is-swarm/) which underpin the Swarm network. To get hands on experience working with Swarm, you can start by learning how to [install and operate a Bee node](/docs/bee/installation/getting-started). 


## Swarm Foundation

The [Swarm Foundation](https://www.ethswarm.org/foundation) is dedicated to advancing open-source technology for decentralized data storage and exchange. It fosters a sustainable, independent ecosystem by supporting the development of free and open-source software (FLOSS) and empowering a community built around crypto-economic incentives for processing, distributing, and storing data.

Its mission is to champion digital freedom by promoting the Swarm network as the foundational layer of the fair data economy, while nurturing the community that sustains it.

To achieve this, the foundation provides financial grants and other forms of support, evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
