Swarm is a peer-to-peer network of Bee nodes that collectively provide censorship resistant decentralised storage and communication services. Swarm's mission is to shape the future towards a self-sovereign global society and permissionless open markets by providing scalable base-layer data storage infrastructure for the decentralised internet. Its incentive system is enforced through smart contracts on the Gnosis Chain blockchain and powered by the xBZZ token, making it economically self-sustaining. 

## Bee Client

Bee is a Swarm client implemented in Go and is the basic building block for the Swarm network. Bee nodes collectively work together to form a private, decentralized, and self sustaining network for permissionless publishing and data storage. 


## Swarm Foundation

The goal of [Swarm Foundation](https://www.ethswarm.org/foundation) is to support and contribute to the creation of technology whose code will be open to all and will allow the storage and exchange of data in a decentralised manner. To this end, the foundation intends in particular to promote and support a community and a sustainable and independent ecosystem for the development of free open source software (FLOSS), allowing for digital services coordinated by crypto-economic incentives that process, distribute and store data.

Its mission is to empower digital freedom by promoting the development and maintenance of the Swarm network, the base layer of the emerging fair data economy, and the community surrounding this network.

It does so by supporting many different initiatives, either through financial grants or other types of support, all of which is assessed on a case-by-case basis.
