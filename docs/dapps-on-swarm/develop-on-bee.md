Bee is the first client to work with the Swarm network. 

## Setting Up Bee for Developing Dapps

To develop apps on Bee, you might need to adjust the following settings. Check out the brand new [bee-factory](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee-factory) for information on how to run a self contained development environment so you can go wild in Swarm without spending all your gBZZ on swap and stamps!

## Hosting Your Dapps & Storing Their Data

Swarm is hugely versatile, but at a very basic level you can think of it as storage for your dapps data that is too big for blockchain, but still needs to live in our totally decentralised universe. Swarm is perfect for storing your NFT meta-data and images in a web3 way that won't break the bank and can live forever!

##Â Your Data Structures on Swarm

As well as your simple data needs, Swarm also provides key-value store / pubsub type primitives, and allows users to store authenticated data signed using a regular Ethereum Wallet. See [chunk types](/docs/dapps-on-swarm/chunk-types) and [feeds](/docs/dapps-on-swarm/feeds) for more info! Let us know what you come up with in the [#develop-on-swarm](https://discord.gg/C6dgqpxZkU) room in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/wdghaQsGq5).

## Bee Proxy Mode

With Bee running as a proxy in [Light Node](/docs/access-the-swarm/light-nodes) mode on your end-user's computers, your applications can have privileged access to all sorts of useful tools and ways to interact with the Swarm. Check out the [API](/docs/api-reference/api-reference) and [Debug API](/docs/api-reference/api-reference) as well as [bee-js](/docs/dapps-on-swarm/bee-js) for details on what you can do with your Bee!

## Dapps With Swarm Gateways

If you want your users to be able to access Swarm without running their own Bee node, for the time being you will need to access Bee in gateway mode. Join us in the [#develop-on-swarm](https://discord.gg/C6dgqpxZkU) room in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/wdghaQsGq5) for more information on how to allow your web app users to read and write to the Swarm.
