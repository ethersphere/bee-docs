While running [Bee](/docs/bee/installation/install) from the terminal is a powerful and flexible approach for developers and node operators, it may not be the best option for more simple use cases.

The Swarm Desktop app is an alternative which provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface for running a Bee node and interacting seamlessly with the Swarm network. The app automatically spins up a Bee ultra-light node in order to allow anyone to use Swarm to upload and download files securely, send encrypted files to others, and host HTML websites with ease. 

The Swarm Desktop App was designed to simplify the Swarm onboarding process so that anyone can benefit from decentralized storage while maintaining privacy and control over their data. Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems, the Swarm Desktop App serves as a personal gateway to the Swarm network.
