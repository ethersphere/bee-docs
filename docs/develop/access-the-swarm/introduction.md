As well as earning xBZZ and supporting the network, Bee is our
entrypoint to Swarm's unstoppable data storage and distribution
system. Swarm is a distributed system designed to work together with
smart contracts, powering the infrastructure that enables the development of full
service applications running entirely on the decentralised web.

Here's just a few of the amazing things you can do with Bee!

### Decentralise Your Files

Bee provides several convenient ways to [upload your data into the Swarm](/docs/develop/access-the-swarm/upload-and-download). Once your data has been uploaded, it will be distributed, stored and retrievable by a worldwide network of p2p nodes, and made available from Swarm's [web gateway](https://gateway.ethswarm.org).

### Upload Whole Directories

Find out how to [upload whole directories](/docs/develop/access-the-swarm/upload-and-download) at once using Bee's HTTP API.

### Host Your Website on the Decentralised Web

Swarm is a distributed international network of nodes that provides hosting for your unstoppable websites. See this guide to [hosting your website on swarm](/docs/develop/access-the-swarm/host-your-website).

### Sync With the Network

Watch as your uploaded data is [synced with the network](/docs/develop/access-the-swarm/syncing) of thousands of nodes worldwide!

### Keep Your Data Alive

Learn how to assign xBZZ to your data using postage stamps so that it remains [live on the Swarm network](/docs/develop/access-the-swarm/buy-a-stamp-batch).

### Pinning

Learn how to [pin your data](/docs/develop/access-the-swarm/pinning) so that it always remains available locally on your Bee node.

### Node Types

Bee nodes can be operated in [three different modes](/docs/bee/working-with-bee/node-types): full, light, and ultra-light. Each mode of operation offers access to different Swarm features.
