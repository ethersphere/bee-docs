## Testing a connection with PingPong protocol

To check if two nodes are connected and to see the round trip time for message exchange between them, get the overlay address from one node, for example local node 2:

```bash
curl localhost:1833/addresses
```

Make sure addresses are configured as in examples above.

And use that address in the API call on another node, for example, local node 1:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:1735/pingpong/d4440baf2d79e481c3c6fd93a2014d2e6fe0386418829439f26d13a8253d04f1
```

## Generating protobuf

To process protocol buffer files and generate the Go code from it two tools are needed:

- [protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases)
- [protoc-gen-gogofaster](https://github.com/gogo/protobuf)

Makefile rule `protobuf` can be used to automate `protoc-gen-gogofaster` installation and code generation:

```bash
make protobuf
```
