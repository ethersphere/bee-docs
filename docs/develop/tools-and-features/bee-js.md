bee-js is Bee's complementary JavaScript library. It is the technology underpinning [swarm-cli](/docs/bee/working-with-bee/swarm-cli) and [Swarm Desktop](/docs/desktop/introduction/) and is a powerful tool for building completely decentralized apps.

See the [bee-js](https://bee-js.ethswarm.org/) documentation for detailed information on using and installing the library.
