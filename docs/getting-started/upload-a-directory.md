It is possible to use Bee to upload whole directory structures at once. 

:::info
If an uploaded directory contain an `index.html` file. When you navigate to the directory in a web browser, it will automatically be served to users from our [Swarm gateways](https://gateway.ethswarm.org) as if it were a website hosted by a normal web server! You can use this feature to host unstoppable websites in Swarm.
:::

This feature makes use of the [tar](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/) command line utility to package the directory into a single file that can then uploaded to the Bee API for processing and distributed into the swarm for later retrieval.

:::caution
G-zip compression is not supported the current version of Bee, so make sure not to use the `-z` flag when using the `tar` command!

## Upload the Directory Containing Your Website
First, use the `tar` command line utility to create an archive containing all the files of your directory. If uploading a website, we must take care to ensure that the `index.html` file is at the root of the directory tree.

```sh
tree build
> 
my_website
├── assets
│   └── style.css
├── index.html
└── error.html
```

Use the following command to ensure that the tar package maintains the correct directory structure.

```sh
tar -cfC my_website . > my_website.tar
```

Next, simply POST the `tar` file as binary data to Bee's `dir` endpoint, taking care to include the header `Content Type: application/x-tar`.

```sh
curl \
	-X POST \
	-H "Content-Type: application/x-tar" \
	-H "Swarm-Index-Document: index.html" \
	-H "Swarm-Error-Document: error.html" 
	--data-binary @my_website.tar http://localhost:1633/dirs
```

:::info
For instances where a Single Page App has a javascript router which handles url queries itself, simple pass `index.html` as the error document, and Bee will pass over control to the javascript served by the `index.html` file in the circumstance that a path does not yield a file from the manifest. 
:::

When the upload is successful, Bee will return a json document containing the Swarm Reference.

```json
{"reference":"b25c89a401d9f26811680476619a1eb4a4e189e614bc6161cbfd8b343214917b"}
```

Now, simply navigate your browser to view the reference using the `bzz` endpoint and your website will be served!

[http://localhost:1633/bzz/b25c89a...214917b/index.html](http://localhost:1633/bzz/b25c89a401d9f26811680476619a1eb4a4e189e614bc6161cbfd8b343214917b/index.html) 

Other files are served at their relative paths, e.g.

[http://localhost:1633/bzz/b25c89a...214917b/assets/style.css](http://localhost:1633/bzz/b25c89a401d9f26811680476619a1eb4a4e189e614bc6161cbfd8b343214917b/assets/style.css) 

Once your data has been [fully processed into the network](/docs/advanced/tags), you will then be able to retrieve it from any Bee node.

[https://gateway.ethswarm.org/bzz/b25c89a...214917b/index.html](https://gateway.ethswarm.org/bzz/b25c89a401d9f26811680476619a1eb4a4e189e614bc6161cbfd8b343214917b/index.html)

If you are not able to download your file from a different Bee node, you may be experiencing connection issues, see [troubleshooting connectivity](/docs/installation/connectivity) for assistance.
