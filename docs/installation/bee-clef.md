:::info
Bee Clef is deprecated and is no longer under active development. It is not required for running a Bee node.
:::

Bee makes use of Go Ethereum's external signer, [Clef](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/tools/clef/introduction).

Because Bee must sign a lot of transactions automatically and quickly, a [Bee specific version of Clef, Bee Clef](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee-clef) has been packaged which includes all the relevant configuration needed to make Clef work with Bee.

:::caution
Bee Clef will create a new Ethereum key pair for you during installation. Make sure you keep a [backup](/docs/working-with-bee/backups) of your key pair somewhere safe and secure!
:::

## Packages

Bee Clef can be installed automatically using your system's package manager.

<TabItem value="macos">

To run Bee Clef as a service now and on startup, run:

```bash
brew services start swarm-clef
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Configuring Bee Clef

Configuration files are stored in `/etc/default/bee-clef/` on Linux and `/usr/local/etc/swarm-clef/default` on MacOS.

To install clef for Swarm mainnet, change `BEE_CLEF_CHAIN_ID` to be `100` in order to interact with the XDAI network. For testnet, use chain id `5`.

For a normal installation using a package manager, this should be the only configuration changes necessary to start using Bee Clef.

### Interact With Bee Clef

Once Bee Clef has been installed, it will begin running as a service.

To check Bee Clef is running ok, we may use `systemctl` (on Linux) or `launchctl` (on MacOS) to query the status of the `bee-clef` service.

<Tabs
defaultValue="linux"
values={[
{label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
{label: 'MacOS', value: 'macos'},
]}>
<TabItem value="linux">

```bash
systemctl status bee-clef
```

```
‚óè bee-clef.service - Bee Clef
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/bee-clef.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Fri 2020-11-20 23:45:16 GMT; 1min 29s ago
```

And if you want to get Bee Clef's logs, you can use:

```bash
journalctl -f -u bee-clef.service
```

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos">

```bash
launchctl list | grep swarm-clef
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When Bee Clef first starts, you should see something very similar to the following:

```log

As soon as `bee` starts interacting with `bee-clef` you should start to see log messages populate, for a regularly active and connected node they will appear every few seconds:

```
Feb 24 22:29:15 comp-name bee-clef-service[1118]: INFO [02-24|22:29:15.118] Op approved

...
```

## Data Locations

Key material and other data is stored in `/var/lib/bee-clef/`

:::info
Bee can communicate with Bee Clef in a variety of ways. The default way, if installed via the packages, will use an Inter-process communication (IPC) file. This is a special file that `bee-clef` creates on startup that Bee will use to send requests back-and-forth. When the `bee-clef` service is running you'll notice that a `/var/lib/bee-clef/clef.ipc` file is created.
:::

## Manual Installation

Try the [Github releases page](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee-clef/releases) for binaries for your platform. Otherwise to install Clef manually first retrieve the relevant Clef binary from Ethereum's [Geth & Tools](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/) download page, or build directly from the [source](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Building-Ethereum).

Because Bee needs Clef to sign many transactions automatically, we must run Clef as a service with relaxed permissions and rules set. To ensure Clef only signs transactions from Bee, we must protect the `clef.ipc` file by **creating a Bee user and setting permissions so that it is only possible for this user to make use of the ipc socket.**

Additionally, Clef requires transaction signatures for the Bee's chequebook interaction.

A shell script automating the post-initialisation permission changing and including the Clef config, `clef-service`, as well as the `4byte.json` transaction signature file and `rules.js` file can all be found in the [bee-clef repository](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee-clef/tree/master/packaging).

Finally, once Clef is running, simply [configure your Bee node](/docs/working-with-bee/configuration) to enable Clef using `--clef-signer-enable` and point Bee to the correct ipc socket using `--clef-signer-endpoint`.
