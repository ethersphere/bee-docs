title: Bee Using Docker
id: docker
---

Docker containers for Bee are hosted at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethersphere/bee) for your convenience.

:::info
Bee-clef is deprecated and is no longer under active development. It is not required for running a Bee node.
:::

If running a Bee _full node_, the [Bee Clef](/docs/installation/bee-clef) external signer may be used. Skip ahead if you are comfortable with `docker` basics for instructions on how to use [docker-compose](/docs/installation/docker#docker-compose) to easily set up Bee with persistent storage and integration with the
Bee Clef container.

### Quick Start

Try Bee out by simply running the following command in your Terminal.

```bash
docker run\
  -p 1635:1635 \
  -p 1634:1634 \
  -p 1633:1633\
  --rm -it ethersphere/bee:stable\
  start \
    --welcome-message="Bzzzz bzzz bzz bzz. üêù" \
    --blockchain-endpoint http://localhost:8545 \
    --debug-api-enable
```

:::info
If starting your node for the first time, you will need to deploy a chequebook contract. See [Manual Installation](/docs/installation/manual) for more info.
:::

To persist files, mount a local directory as follows and enter the
password used to encrypt your keyfiles. Note, `docker` insists on
absolute paths when mounting volumes, so you must replace
`/path/to/.bee-docker` with a valid path from your local filesystem.

```bash
docker run\
  -v /path/to/.bee-docker:/home/bee/.bee\
  -p 1635:1635 \
  -p 1634:1634 \
  -p 1633:1633\
  --rm -it ethersphere/bee:stable\
  start \
    --welcome-message="Bzzzz bzzz bzz bzz. üêù" \
    --blockchain-endpoint https://stake.getblock.io/mainnet/?api_key=your-api-key \
	  --debug-api-enable
```

Once you have generated your keys, leave Bee to run in the background...

```bash
docker run\
  -d
  -v /path/to/.bee-docker:/home/bee/.bee\
  -p 1635:1635 \
  -p 1634:1634 \
  -p 1633:1633\
  --rm -it ethersphere/bee:stable\
  start \
    --welcome-message="Bzzzz bzzz bzz bzz. üêù" \
    --blockchain-endpoint https://stake.getblock.io/mainnet/?api_key=your-api-key \
	  --debug-api-enable
```

### Versions

In order to avoid accidentally upgrading your Bee containers, or
deadlocks resulting from Docker caching solutions, it is recommended
to use best practices and pin the specific version of Bee that you
want to run.

#### Specific Versions

```bash
docker pull ethersphere/bee:1.11.1
```

#### Using Tags

```bash
docker pull ethersphere/bee:beta
```

You may use the tags `beta`, `latest`, and `stable`, or find out more
at the [Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethersphere/bee).

### Docker Compose

Configuration files for Bee and Bee Clef are provided to enable quick
and easy installation of both programs with persistent storage and
secure secret management. To install Bee without Clef, simply omit the
relevant steps.

#### Setup

First, retrieve the current `docker-compose.yaml` file.

```bash
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethersphere/bee/v1.4.1/packaging/docker/docker-compose.yml
```

Next, create a `.env` file using the example file provided. This file will be responsible for storing configuration and secrets for our Bee and Bee Clef applications.

```bash
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethersphere/bee/v1.4.1/packaging/docker/env -O .env
```

There are some important configuration parameters which must be set in order for our projects to work. To affect configuration in the `.env` file, we first remove the `#` at the beginning of the line and then change the value after `=` to our desired config.

For Bee, amend the following parameters:

```
BEE_BLOCKCHAIN_ENDPOINT=https://stake.getblock.io/mainnet/?api_key=your-api-key
BEE_PASSWORD=my-password
```

To enable Clef support on mainnet, we must also change the following params:

```
CLEF_CHAINID=100
```

For testnet, use chain id `5`.

```
BEE_CLEF_SIGNER_ENABLE=true
BEE_CLEF_SIGNER_ENDPOINT=http://clef-1:8550
```

With the configuration settings complete, you can start your Bee and
Clef nodes by running:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

:::tip
By specifying the `-d` flag to `docker-compose` we run Bee and Bee Clef as a daemon.
:::

:::warning
Docker Compose will create a Docker Volume called `bee` containing important key material. Make sure to [backup](/docs/working-with-bee/backups) the contents of your Docker volume!
:::

To determine the Bee node's address to fund, we can check the logs for our Bee _container_:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f bee-1
```

```
bee_1 | time="2020-12-15T18:43:14Z" level=warning msg="cannot continue until there is sufficient ETH (for Gas) and at least 1 BZZ available on 7a977fa660e2e93e1eba40030c6b8da68d01971e"
time="2020-12-15T18:43:14Z" level=warning msg="learn how to fund your node by visiting our docs at https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/installation/fund-your-node"
```

Once you have determined your Bee's Ethereum addresses,
[fund your node](/docs/installation/fund-your-node).

After your transaction has been completed, your node should recognise that your wallet has been funded, and begin to deploy and fund your Bee chequebook!

Once Bee has completed this procedure, you may query the Bee [HTTP API](/docs/api-reference/api-reference) at `http://localhost:1633`.

```bash
curl localhost:1633
```

```
Ethereum Swarm Bee
```

Once you start seeing messages in the `docker-compose logs -f bee-1`
like:

```
successfully connected to peer 7fa40ce124d69ecf14d6f7806faaf9df5d639d339a9d343aa7004373f5c46b8f (outbound)
```

You're connected to the Swarm. Let's do a quick check to find out how
many peers we have using the `curl` command line utility:

```bash
curl localhost:1635/peers
```

```json
{
  "peers": [
    {
      "address": "339cf2ca75f154ffb8dd13de024c4a5c5b53827b8fd21f24bec05835e0cdc2e8"
    },
    {
      "address": "b4e5df012cfc281e74bb517fcf87fc2c07cd787929c332fc805f8124401fabae"
    }
  ]
}
```

If you see peers listed here - congratulations! You have joined the
swarm! Welcome! üêù
