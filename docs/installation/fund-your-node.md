## Mainnet

Your Bee node needs BZZ to be able to properly interact with the network. In order to receive these, you will need to acquire BZZ, then bridge your BZZ to the XDAI chain.

To bridge your xDai, you may use [omni bridge](https://omni.xdaichain.com/bridge). Please note that the address of the BZZ token contract on xDai chain ([`0xdBF3Ea6F5beE45c02255B2c26a16F300502F68da`](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/tokens/0xdBF3Ea6F5beE45c02255B2c26a16F300502F68da/)) is different from that on the Ethereum chain.

To work out what your node's Ethereum address is, please consult your relevant installation guide or check your logs!


## Testnet

Your Bee node needs gBZZ to be able to properly interact with the test network. In order to receive these, you will need to sign into our Discord and request your gBZZ test tokens from the [#faucet](https://discord.gg/kfKvmZfVfe) channel, using your node's Ethereum address.

To work out what your node's Ethereum address is, please consult your relevant installation guide or check your logs!

Once you have determined your Ethereum address, join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/wdghaQsGq5) and navigate to the [#faucet](https://discord.gg/kfKvmZfVfe) channel. After you have [verified your username](https://discord.gg/tXGPdzZQaV) (and said hi! 👋 ), use our Faucet Bot to get your test tokens.

Here you must **type** (not copy paste) the following, replacing the address with your own:

```
/faucet sprinkle 0xabeeecdef123452a40f6ea9f598596ca8556bd57
```

If you have problems, please let us know by making a post in the [#faucet](https://discord.gg/kfKvmZfVfe) channel, we will do our best to provide tokens to everyone. 

Transactions may take a while to complete, please be patient. We're also keen for you to join us in the swarm, and indeed you soon will! 🐝 &nbsp 🐝 &nbsp 🐝
