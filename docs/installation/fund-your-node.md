Your Bee node needs BZZ to be able to properly interact with the network. In order to receive these, you will need to sign into our Discord and request your BZZ test tokens from the [#faucet](https://discord.gg/kfKvmZfVfe) channel, using your node's Ethereum address.

To work out what your node's Ethereum address is, please consult your relevant installation guide or check your logs!

Once you have determined your Ethereum address, join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/wdghaQsGq5) and navigate to the [#faucet](https://discord.gg/kfKvmZfVfe) channel. After you have [verified your username](https://discord.gg/tXGPdzZQaV) (and said hi! 👋 ), use our Faucet Bot to get your test tokens.

Here you must **type** (not copy paste) the following, replacing the address with your own:

```
/faucet sprinkle 0xabeeecdef123452a40f6ea9f598596ca8556bd57
```

If you have problems, please let us know by making a post in the [#faucet](https://discord.gg/kfKvmZfVfe) channel, we will do our best to provide tokens to everyone. 

Transactions may take a while to complete, please be patient. We're also keen for you to join us in the swarm, and indeed you soon will! 🐝 &nbsp 🐝 &nbsp 🐝
