:::tip
We recommend even our most 1337 readers go through a [single installation](/docs/installation/install) first to get a taste of Bee, and to understand the nuances of the implementations. ðŸ‘¾
:::

Because of how the Swarm is structured, we recommend that users wishing to scale up their Bee operation, or set up a commercial Bee hive should seek to run many instances of Bee simulataneously. Read <a href="/the-book-of-swarm-viktor-tron-v1.0-pre-release7.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Book of Swarm</a>  for more information on how the Swarm comes together.

Swarm provides tooling to help you install many Bees at once.

### Docker

Up to date [Docker images for Bee and Bee Clef](/docs/installation/docker) are provided.

### Docker-Compose

It becomes easier to run multiple Bee nodes with `docker-compose`. Check out the Docker compose section of the [Docker README](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee/tree/master/packaging/docker).

### Helm

If you really want to run a lot of Bee nodes and you have experience using Kubernetes with Helm, you can have a look at how we manage our cluster under [Ethersphere/helm](https://github.com/ethersphere/helm/tree/master/charts/bee).

### Manually

If you just want to run a handful of bee nodes, you can run multiple bee nodes by creating separate configuration files.

Create your first configuration file by running

```console
bee printconfig \
  &> bee-config-1.yaml
```
Make as many copies of bee-config-1.yaml as you want to run bee nodes. Increment the number in the name (`bee-config-1` to `bee-config-2`) for each new configuration file.

Configure your nodes as desired, but ensure that the values `api-addr`, `data-dir`, `debug-api-addr`, `p2p-addr` and `clef-signer-endpoint` are unique for each configuration.

### Monitoring

See the monitoring section on how to access Bee's internal metrics! Share your community creations (like [swarmMonitor](https://github.com/doristeo/SwarmMonitoring) - thanks doristeo!) in the [#node-operators](https://discord.gg/X3ph5yGRFU) channel of our Discord server so we can add you to our list of all things that are [awesome](/docs/community/awesome-swarm) and Swarm. ðŸ§¡
