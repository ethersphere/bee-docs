Swarm thrives on decentralisation, is designed so that it
works best when many individuals contribute to the health and
distributed nature of the network by running Bee nodes.

It is easy to set up Bee on small and inexpensive computers, such as a [Raspberry Pi 4](/docs/installation/rasp-bee-ry-pi), spare hardware you have lying around, or even a cheap cloud hosted VPS (we recommend small, independent providers and colocations).

## Installing Bee

Steps for running a Bee node:

1.  Install Bee and set it up to run as a service.
2.  Configure Bee.
3.  [Fund your node](/docs/installation/fund-your-node) with XDAI and BZZ for the mainnet and gETH and gBZZ for our testnet.
4.  Wait for your chequebook transactions to complete and batch store to update.
5.  Back up your keys.
6.  Check if Bee is working.

:::info
  Holding a high value of BZZ or XDAI in a node wallet is not recommended. Node operators should consider regularly removing accumulated funds.

## 1. Install Bee

Bee is available as a package for Debian (Ubuntu) and Centos from our GitHub, and is available for MacOS through Homebrew.

If your system is not supported, please see the [manual installation](/docs/installation/manual) section for information on how to install Bee.

If you would like to run a hive of many Bees, check out the [node hive operators](/docs/installation/hive) section for information on how to operate and monitor many Bees at once.

## 2. Configure Bee

Bee is a versatile piece of software with diverse use cases. Before
starting Bee for the first time you will need to configure it to suit your needs.


### Edit Config File

To alter Bee's configuration, edit the configuration file (default `/etc/bee/bee.yaml`), and then restart your Bee service. Configuration settings may also be set by modifying environment variables or with command line flags. See the [configuration](/docs/working-with-bee/configuration#environment-variables) page for more details.

### CentOS ᙇ

```bash

#### MacOS

```bash
vi /usr/local/etc/swarm-bee/bee.yaml
brew services restart swarm-bee
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Important Configuration

#### Full Node, Light Node

Bee runs as a light node by default. If you want to run Bee as a full node in order to contribute your resources and provide services to the network in exchange for bandwidth in kind and perhaps even earn some BZZ, simply set the `--full-node` flag to `true`.

```yaml
## bee.yaml
full-node: true
```

### NAT Address

Swarm is all about sharing and storing chunks of data. To enable other
Bees (also known as _peers_) to connect to your Bee, you must
broadcast your public IP address in order to ensure that Bee is reachable on
the correct p2p port (default `1634`). We recommend that you [manually
configure your external IP and check
connectivity](/docs/installation/connectivity) to ensure your Bee is
able to receive connections from other peers.

First determine your public IP address:

```bash
curl icanhazip.com
```

```
123.123.123.123
```

Then configure your node, including your p2p port (default 1634).

```yaml
## bee.yaml
nat-addr: "123.123.123.123:1634"
```

#### Blockchain RPC Endpoints

Your Bee node must have _stable_ access to a Gnosis Chain RPC endpoint, so that it
can interact with and deploy your chequebook contract, and see the latest view of the current postage batches, as well as to interact with and top up your own batches.

We recommend you [run your own Gnosis Chain Node](https://docs.gnosischain.com/clients/gnosis-chain-node-openethereum-and-nethermind).
If you do not wish to sync your own nodes, and are willing to trust a third party, you may also consider using an RPC endpoint provider such as [GetBlock](https://getblock.io/).

By default, Bee expects a local Gnosis Chain node at `ws://localhost:8545`. To use a Gnosis Chain RPC provider instead, change your configuration to use the API endpoint URL they provide, for example:

```yaml
## bee.yaml
blockchain-endpoint: https://gno.getblock.io/mainnet/?api_key=b338ee33-b3e3-be33-bee5-b335b555b555
```

#### Funding Your Chequebook (Optional)

You may select how much BZZ to fund your wallet with. If you are happy to stay within the free usage limits initially, you may select `0`.

```yaml
## bee.yaml
swap-initial-deposit: 0
```

We recommend 1 BZZ as denominated in PLUR — `10000000000000000` — as a good starter amount, but you can start with more if you will be paying for a lot of interactions on the network.

#### ENS Resolution (Optional)

The [ENS](https://ens.domains/) domain resolution system is used to host websites on Bee, and in order to use this your Bee must be connected to a mainnet Ethereum blockchain node. We recommend you sign up to [Infura's](https://infura.io) API service and set your `--resolver-options` to `https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your-api-key`.

```yaml
## bee.yaml
resolver-options: ["https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<<your-api-key>>"]
```

## Fund Your Bee

Your Bee must deploy a chequebook contract to keep track of its exchanges with other Bees in the Swarm. To do that you must deposit XDAI and optionally [xBZZ](/docs/installation/fund-your-node).

First, find out your Bee's Ethereum address:

<Tabs
defaultValue="debian"
values={[
{label: 'Ubuntu / Debian / Raspbian', value: 'debian'},
{label: 'CentOS', value: 'centos'},
{label: 'MacOS', value: 'macos'},

<TabItem value="debian">

#### Linux

```bash
sudo bee-get-addr
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="centos">

### CentOS

```bash
sudo bee-get-addr
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos">

#### MacOS

```bash
head -18 $(brew --prefix)/var/log/swarm-bee/bee.log | grep ethereum
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once you have determined your Bee's Ethereum address, [fund your
node](/docs/installation/fund-your-node) with XDAI and xBZZ

If too much time has elapsed, you may need to [restart your
node](#edit-config-file) at this point.

## Wait for Initialisation

When first started, Bee must deploy a chequebook to the Gnosis Chain
blockchain, and sync the postage stamp batch store so that it can
check chunks for validity when storing or forwarding them. This can
take a while, so please be patient! Once this is complete, you will
see Bee starting to add peers and connect to the network.

You can keep an eye on progress by watching the logs while this is taking place.

:::info
While you are waiting for Bee to initalise, this is a great time to [back up your keys](/docs/working-with-bee/backups) so you can them safe.
:::


## Check If Bee Is Working

Once Bee has been funded, the chequebook deployed, and postage stamp
batch store synced, its HTTP [API](/docs/api-reference/api-reference)
will start listening at `localhost:1633`.

To check everything is working as expected, send a GET request to localhost port 1633.

```bash
curl localhost:1633
```

```
Ethereum Swarm Bee
```

Great! Our API is listening!

Next, let's see if we have connected with any peers by querying our
[Debug API](/docs/working-with-bee/debug-api).

:::info
Here we are using the `jq` utility to parse our javascript. Use your package manager to install `jq`, or simply remove everything after and including the first `|` to view the raw json without it.
:::

```bash
curl -s localhost:1635/peers | jq ".peers | length"
```

```
87
```

Perfect! We are accumulating peers, this means you are connected to
the network, and ready to start [using
Bee](/docs/access-the-swarm/introduction) to [upload and
download](/docs/access-the-swarm/upload-and-download) content or host
and browse [websites](/docs/access-the-swarm/host-your-website) hosted
on the Swarm network.

Welcome to the swarm! 🐝 🐝 🐝 🐝 🐝

## Deposit Stake for Your Node

In order to start receiving rewards, you will need to [deposit BZZ to the staking contract](/docs/installation/staking) for your node. To do this, send a minimum of 10 BZZ to your nodes' wallet and run:

```bash
curl -XPOST localhost:1635/stake/100000000000000000
```

This will initiate a transaction on-chain which deposits the specified amount of BZZ into the staking contract. 

Rewards are only available for full nodes which are providing storage capacity to the network.
