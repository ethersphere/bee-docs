Bee is a versatile piece of software that caters for a diverse array of use cases. 

### Access the Network

If you want to interact with the Bee ecosystem in a decentralised way, but not earn gBZZ by storing or forwarding chunks, simply run Bee in the background in [light node](/docs/access-the-swarm/light-nodes) mode on your laptop or desktop computer for direct access to the swarm for your web browser and other applications.

[Install Bee](/docs/installation/install)

### Support the Network and Earn gBZZ by Running a Full Node

Earn [gBZZ](/docs/working-with-bee/cashing-out) and help keep the swarm strong by running your own **full node**. It's easy to set up your own Bee on your [Raspberry Pi](/docs/installation/rasp-bee-ry-pi), cloud host or any home computer that's connected to the internet. 

[Install Bee](/docs/installation/install)

### Run Your Own Hive of Nodes

Take it to the next level by keeping a whole hive of Bees. We provide tooling and monitoring to help you manage large deployments of many Bee nodes.
