Bee is a versatile piece of software that caters for a diverse array of use cases. 

### Access the Network

If you want to interact with the Bee ecosystem in a decentralised way,
but not earn BZZ by storing or forwarding chunks, simply run a Bee
[light node](/docs/access-the-swarm/light-nodes) in the background on
your laptop or desktop computer. This will enable direct access to the
swarm from your web browser and other applications.

Or if you want to interact with the Bee ecosystem for a shorter period of
time you can run Bee in [ultra light node](/docs/access-the-swarm/ultra-light-nodes)
This will allow you to download data but otherwise it has very limited functionality.

[Install Bee](/docs/installation/install)

### Support the Network and Earn BZZ by Running a Full Node

Earn [BZZ](/docs/working-with-bee/cashing-out) and help keep the swarm
strong by running your own **full node**. It's easy to set up your own
Bee on a [Raspberry Pi](/docs/installation/rasp-bee-ry-pi), cloud
host, or any home computer that's connected to the internet.

[Install Bee](/docs/installation/install)

### Run Your Own Hive of Nodes

Take it to the next level by keeping a whole hive of Bees! We provide
tooling and monitoring to help you manage large deployments of
multiple Bee nodes: [Bee Hives](/docs/installation/hive).
