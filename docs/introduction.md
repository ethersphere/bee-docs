**Swarm** is a **decentralized data storage and distribution technology**, ready to power the next generation of **censorship-resistant**, **unstoppable serverless apps**.

Swarm is economically self-sustaining due to a built-in incentive system enforced through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Our team aspires to shape the future towards a self-sovereign global society and permissionless open markets. Applications can run autonomously yet securely in a planetary-scale deployment and execution environment.

As soon as the Bee client is up and running it will begin to connect with peers all over the world to become part of Swarm, a global p2p network tasked with storing and distributing all of the world's data.

## Whitepaper & The Book of Swarm

What happens with a Bee node after startup? Want to know more about the Swarm technology behind Bee? Or planning to set up your client?

Start by reading the <a href="/swarm-whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Swarm Whitepaper**</a> and for a deeper dive, <a href="/the-book-of-swarm.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**The Book of Swarm**</a>,
our 250-page guide to the technology underpinning the Ethereum Swarm network.

## Bonding Curve

You can find more information on the bonding curve, including its [source code](https://github.com/ethersphere/bzzaar-contracts) in the official Github repository.

## Bee Client

### Installation

It's easy to install the Bee client. Simply head over to the [Installation](/docs/installation/quick-start) section to get your Bee client up and running.

### Working With Bee

Once Bee is installed, it‚Äôs time to find out how to configure the software, interact with the API, monitor what Bee is up to, and make all those important backups. Check out the [working with Bee](/docs/working-with-bee/introduction) section for further instructions.

### Access the Swarm

To learn more about how to get the most out of your Bee client, find out how to [access the swarm](/docs/access-the-swarm/upload-and-download) section. You can share files with your friends, use Bee to host a website on a public Swarm Gateway, and much more!

### API Reference

[Find detailed information](/docs/api-reference/api-reference) on all the endpoints available in the autogenerated <a href="/api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**API reference**</a> and <a href="/debug-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Debug API reference**</a> guides.

## dApps

Swarm is all about dApps. It strives to provide the most developer-friendly environment on which to build decentralized organizations.

Built on the principles of functionality, flexibility, and accessibility, Bee provides high-level constructs for file storage, feeds and key-value stores, while also providing the low-level access with libraries that create Single Owner and Trojan chunks clientside, with complete end-to-end privacy. Learn more about how to start [building on Swarm](/docs/dapps-on-swarm/introduction).

## Incentives

Need even more incentive to get involved with the wonderful world of Swarm? Find out how you can [earn BZZ tokens](/docs/working-with-bee/cashing-out) for storing and distributing your share of the world's data - **sharing is caring!**

## Find Out More

## Development

If you are up to the challenge of creating Bee and the other incredible technologies that are being built on top of it, you are invited to contribute code to the Bee client or any of the other projects in Swarm's [Ethersphere](https://github.com/ethersphere).
