Hello and welcome to Swarm! üêù 

As soon as the Bee client is up and running it will begin to connect with peers all over the world to become part of Swarm, a global p2p network tasked with storing and distributing all of the world's data.

Swarm is a decentralised data storage and distribution technology, ready to power the next generation of censorship resistant, unstoppable serverless apps.

Swarm is economically self-sustaining due to a built-in incentive system enforced through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Swarm aspires to shape the future towards a self-sovereign global society and permissionless open markets. Applications can run autonomously yet securely in a planetary-scale deployment and execution environment.

# Swarm

## Swarm Whitepaper and The Book of Swarm
What happens with a Bee node after startup? Want to know more about the Swarm technology behind Bee?
Want to make your own client? Read the <a href="/swarm-whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swarm Whitepaper</a> and for a deeper dive, <a href="/the-book-of-swarm.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Book of Swarm</a> ,
our 250 page guide to the tech underpinning the Swarm network.

## Bonding Curve

Find more information on the bonding curve, including its [source code](https://github.com/ethersphere/bzzaar-contracts) in the github repository.

# Bee

## Installation
Don't have Bee installed yet? It's easy! Head over to the [installation](/docs/installation/quick-start) section to get Bee up and running.

## Working With Bee
Once Bee is installed, find out how to configure the software, interact with the API, monitor what Bee is up to, and make those all important backups in the [working with Bee](/docs/working-with-bee/introduction) section.

## Access the Swarm
To learn more about how to get the most out of Bee, find out how to [access the swarm](/docs/access-the-swarm/upload-and-download) section so you can share files with your friends, use Bee to host a website on a public Swarm Gateway, and much more!
	
## API Reference
[Find detailed information](/docs/api-reference/api-reference) on all the endpoints available in the autogenerated <a href="/api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API reference</a> and <a href="/debug-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Debug API reference</a> guides.

## Dapps

Swarm is all about dapps. It strives to provide the most developer
friendly environment on which to build decentralised
organisations. Built on the principles of functionality, flexibility
and accessibility, Bee provides high level constructs for file
storage, feeds and key-value stores, while also providing the low
level access with libraries that create Single Owner and Trojan chunks
clientside, with total e2e privacy. Learn more about how to [develop
on Swarm](/docs/dapps-on-swarm/introduction).

## Incentives

Need even more incentive to get involved with the wonderful world of
Swarm? Find out how you can [earn BZZ
tokens](/docs/working-with-bee/cashing-out) for storing and
distributing your share of the world's data - sharing is caring!

## Find Out More
