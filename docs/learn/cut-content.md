# Bee

## Installation

Don't have Bee installed yet? It's easy! Head over to the [installation](/docs/bee/installation/quick-start) section to get Bee up and running.

## Working With Bee

Once Bee is installed, find out how to configure the software, interact with the API, monitor what Bee is up to, and make those all important backups in the [working with Bee](/docs/bee/working-with-bee/introduction) section.

## Access the Swarm

To learn more about how to get the most out of Bee, find out how to [access the swarm](/docs/develop/access-the-swarm/upload-and-download) section so you can share files with your friends, use Bee to host a website on a public Swarm Gateway, and much more!

## API Reference

[Find detailed information](/docs/api-reference/) on all the endpoints available in the autogenerated <a href="/api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API reference</a> and <a href="/debug-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Debug API reference</a> guides.

## Dapps

Swarm is all about dapps. It strives to provide the most developer
friendly environment on which to build decentralised
organisations. Built on the principles of functionality, flexibility
and accessibility, Bee provides high level constructs for file
storage, feeds and key-value stores, while also providing the low
level access with libraries that create Single Owner and Trojan chunks
clientside, with total e2e privacy. Learn more about how to [develop
on Swarm](/docs/develop/tools-and-features/introduction).

## Incentives

Need even more incentive to get involved with the wonderful world of
Swarm? Find out how you can [earn xBZZ
tokens](/docs/bee/working-with-bee/cashing-out) for storing and
distributing your share of the world's data - sharing is caring!
