## Grants and Bounties

Swarm grants support many interesting projects that are already building their products on top of Swarm. Swarm bounties extend the ecosystem with tooling and infrastructure. 

If you have an idea for a project which uses Swarm's technology we welcome you to [apply for a grant](https://grants.ethswarm.org).

Learn more about grants for building on Swarm at the [EthSwarm homepage](https://www.ethswarm.org/grants).
