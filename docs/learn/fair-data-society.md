The [Fair Data Society (FDS)](https://fairdatasociety.org/) is a coordinated network developing infrastructure and dApps for a fairer data economy and promoting human rights through digital sovereignty. It is a movement and vision aimed at promoting a decentralized, equitable, and sustainable digital ecosystem that respects individual privacy and data ownership. Its core goal is to empower individuals with control over their data, ensuring that data is used ethically and transparently, while fostering a more balanced relationship between individuals, organizations, and governments.

While FDS is an independent organization, it shares Swarm's vision for the future of data and the decentralized web. FDS uses Swarm's technology as the foundation for the software it develops and incubates for the purpose of realizing its goals.
