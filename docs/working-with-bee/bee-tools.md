### Bee Dashboard

Our wonderful community (shout out to [matmertz25](https://github.com/matmertz25)!) have teamed up with our inimitable javascript team, the Bee Gees 🕺 , to create [Bee Dashboard](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee-dashboard) a graphical user interface for your Bee.

Use this tool to make sure your Bee is functioning correctly, keep an
eye on cheques as they accumulate, and cash them out, withdraw your
earned BZZ, and much more!

Head over to the [Github repo](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee-dashboard) for more information on how to install and use *Bee Dashboard*.

### Swarm CLI

If you're comfortable with nodejs and the command line, we recommend you try interacting with your Bee using the mighty [swarm-cli](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm-cli). 

**Swarm CLI** is a javascript based companion for your Bee node that can maintain multiple identities, makes it super easy to host your websites and will allow you to interact with some of Swarm's more advanced features such as [feeds](/docs/dapps-on-swarm/feeds).

Instructions on how to install and use *swarm-cli* are maintained at the [Github repository](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm-cli).
