Your Bee node can be configured by adding arguments terminal command on startup. 

Run `bee start --help` in your Terminal to get the list of available command line arguments.

#### Important Configuration Changes

:::important
When you start up Bee for the first time, there is some configuration to do! Make sure you consider updating the following recommended settings!
:::

### Full Node

Bee runs as default in [Light Node](/docs/access-the-swarm/light-nodes) mode. To fully participate in the swarm, you must set your `--full-node` configuration to `true`.

### Swap Endpoint

In order to access the blockchain, your Bee must be connected to an XDAI blockchain node on the XDAI network. We recommend running your own XDAI Node, but if you prefer, you may also sign up to [getblock.io](https://getblock.io) API service and set your url to be `https://stake.getblock.io/mainnet/?api_key=your-api-key`

### NAT Address

To enable others to connect to your node, you must broadcast your public IP and ensure Bee is accessible on the right p2p port (usually `1634`). We recommend you [manually configure your external IP and check connectivity](/docs/installation/connectivity) to ensure your Bee is able to receive connections from other peers.

First determine your IP address.

```bash
curl icanhazip.com
```

```bash
123.123.123.123
```

Then configure your node, including your p2p port (usually 1634).

```yaml
nat-addr: "123.123.123.123:1634"
```

### LevelDB Open File Descriptors Limit

Bee is designed to work on a lot of different hardware. To facilitate
the exploration of this during our beta phase, we have given node
operators access to leveldb's `--db-open-files-limit`. This influences
the speed with which Bee can read and write to its database, and
therefore its performance in forwarding and serving chunks. Some say
setting this to much more than the default 200 leads to a much
enhanced ability to participate in the swarm and to get those BZZ!
Share your experience in the #node-operators channel of our [Discord
server](https://discord.gg/wdghaQsGq5) to help us make this process
more automated in the future!

### ENS Endpoint

The ENS domain resolution system is used to host websites on Bee, and in order to use this your Bee must be connected to an Ethereum blockchain node on the main network. If you would like to [browse the swarm](/docs/access-the-swarm/browse-the-swarm) We recommend you sign up to [Infura's](https://infura.io) API service and set your `--resolver-options=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your-api-key`.

## Specifying Configuration

### Configuration file
Bee can also be configured by providing a yaml configuration file using the `--config` flag.

```bash
bee start --config /home/<user>/bee-config.yaml 
```

:::tip
Run `bee printconfig &> bee-default.yaml` to print a default version of the configuration file.
:::

### Environment variables

Bee config may also be passed using environment variables.

Environment variables are set as variables in your operating systems session or systemd configuration file. To set an environment variable, type the following in your terminal session.

```bash
export VARIABLE_NAME=variableValue
```

Verify if it is correctly set by running `echo $VARIABLE_NAME`.

All available configuration options are also available as prefixed, captilised and underscored environment variables.

e.g. `--api-addr` becomes `BEE_API_ADDR`.

### Precedence Order of Configuration

Configuration is processed in the following ascending priority order of preference:

1. Command Line Variables
2. Environment Variables
3. Configuration File

## Configuring Bee Installed Using a Package Manager

Bee node's installed using package managers `apt-get` or `yum` are configured using a configuration file which is automatically generated during the installation process.

To alter Bee's configuration, simply edit the configuration file as desired, and restart your Bee node using `systemctl`.

#### Linux

```bash
sudo vi /etc/bee/bee.yaml
sudo systemctl restart bee
```

#### MacOS

```bash
vi /usr/local/etc/swarm-bee/bee.yaml
brew services restart swarm-bee
```

### Automatically generate a config file

Configuration files can be easily generated by simply substituting the `start` command with `printconfig` when starting Bee using the command line.

#### Example

Here we substitute `start` for `printconfig` when specifying arguments at the command line.

```bash
bee printconfig \
  --verbosity=5 \
  &> bee-config.yaml
```

This produces the following file contents, showing the default configuration of Bee, with some added log verbosity:

## Configuration Options

Bee provides the following options to customise your node.

### Global

#### --config

*default* `/home/<user>/.bee.yaml`

The location of a yaml configuration file containing configuration instructions. See [configuration](#configuration-file).

### Start

#### --api-addr

*default* :1633

The ip and port the API will serve http requests from. Ommiting the IP part of the address will cause the server to listen to all interfaces. Argument values are of the form '132.132.132.132:1633'.

#### --block-time

*default* 15

The expected block time of the attached SWAP endpoint.

#### --bootnode

*default* `/dnsaddr/bootnode.ethswarm.org`

This is a [multiaddr](https://github.com/multiformats/multiaddr) specifying the Bee bootnodes used for bootstrapping the network, it can be multiple values. 

By default a node connects to the Swarm mainnet.  When using a private or test network, network specific bootnodes must be set. 

Any Bee node in a network can act as a bootnode.

#### --cache-capacity

*default* `1000000`

The amount of disk space, in chunks, that is used for forwarding and uploading chunks.

#### --clef-signer-enable             

*default* `false`

Set this to true to enable signing using Ethereum's 'Clef' external signer. Clef is an new feature which requires a corresponding rules files or running in advanced mode to allow for auto-signing of handshakes and cheques.

#### --clef-signer-endpoint

*default* **default path for clef for each host operating system**

You may also specify a custom ipc file path for your Clef signer.

#### --clef-signer-ethereum-address

*default* **selects the clef address at index 0**

Use this command to specify which Bee Clef address is used if you have imported multiple keys into Bee Clef.

:::warning
If you have multiple addresses imported into your instance of Bee Clef, you must specify your address for each node, including the first one, as addresses may been re-ordered during import.
:::

#### --cors-allowed-origins

*default* `[]`

Http/WS origin domains or wildcards defining these, which the API will allow responses to, e.g.

```bash
bee start --cors-allowed-origins="*"
bee start --cors-allowed-origins="https://website.ethswarm.org"
```

#### --data-dir

*default* `/home/<user>/.bee`

The location on your disk where Bee stores its data. This consists of
the following three types of data.

Data in this directory will be required to restore a node state using the same key.

##### 1. Chunk Data

This consists of chunks and files that you have pinned locally, cached chunks you have requested, or chunks within your radius of responsibility which you are responsible for serving to your peers.

##### 2. State Data

This is information about the local state of your Bee node and should be backed up.

##### 3. Keystore Data

These files contain encrypted versions of your private key and should be backed up and kept private.

:::danger
Keep the key files in your keystore data directory safe! 

They are the cryptographic proof of your network identity and cannot be recovered.
