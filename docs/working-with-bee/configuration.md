Bee is a very flexible program, and can be configured in a variety of ways depending on your use case. This expanded section will cover configuration in detail.

## Important Configuration Changes

:::important
Before starting Bee for the first time, there is *some* configuration to do! Make sure you consider updating the following recommended settings!
:::

### Full Node

By default, Bee runs as a [light node](/docs/access-the-swarm/light-nodes). To fully participate in the Swarm, you must set your `--full-node` option to `true`.

### Swap Endpoint

In order to access the blockchain, your Bee must be connected to an Ethereum blockchain node on the Goerli network. We recommend running your own [Geth Goerli Node](https://geth.ethereum.org/), but if you prefer, you may also sign up to [Infura's](https://infura.io) API service and set your `wss://goerli.infura.io/ws/v3/your-api-key`

### NAT Address

To enable others to connect to your node, you must broadcast your public IP and ensure Bee is accessible on the correct p2p port (default `1634`). We recommend you [manually configure your external IP and check connectivity](/docs/installation/connectivity) to ensure your Bee is able to receive inbound connections from other peers.

First determine your public IP address.

```bash
curl icanhazip.com
```

```bash
123.123.123.123
```

Then configure your node, including your p2p port (default `1634`).

```yaml
nat-addr: "123.123.123.123:1634"
```

### LevelDB Open File Descriptors Limit

Bee is designed to work on a lot of different hardware. To facilitate the exploration of this during our beeta phase, we have given node operators access to leveldb's `--db-open-files-limit`. This helps determine the speed with which Bee can read and write to it's database, and therefore it's efficiency in forwarding and serving chunks.

Some say setting this to much more than the default 200 leads to a much enhanced ability to participate in the Swarm and get those gBZZ! Share your experience in the [#node-operators](https://discord.gg/X3ph5yGRFU) channel of our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/wdghaQsGq5) to help us make this process more automated in the future!

### ENS Endpoint

The ENS domain resolution system is used to host websites on Bee, and in order to use this your Bee must be connected to an Ethereum blockchain node on the main network. If you would like to [browse the swarm](/docs/access-the-swarm/browse-the-swarm) We recommend you sign up to [Infura's](https://infura.io) API service and set your `--resolver-options=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your-api-key`.

## Specifying Configuration

### Configuration Priority

Configuration is processed in the following ascending order of preference:

1. Command Line Arguments
2. Environment Variables
3. Configuration File

### Command Line Arguments

Run `bee start --help` in your Terminal to get the list of available command line arguments.

### Environment variables

Bee config may also be passed using environment variables.

Environment variables are set as variables in your operating system's session or systemd configuration file. To set an environment variable, type the following in your terminal session.

```bash
export VARIABLE_NAME=variableValue
```

Verify if it is correctly set by running `echo $VARIABLE_NAME`.

All available configuration options are available as `BEE` prefixed, capitalised, and underscored environment variables.

e.g. `--api-addr` becomes `BEE_API_ADDR`.


### Configuration file
Bee can also be configured by providing a YAML configuration file using the `--config` flag.

```bash
bee start --config /home/<user>/bee-config.yaml 
```

#### Automatically generate a config file

Configuration files can be easily generated by simply substituting the `start` command with `printconfig` when starting Bee using the command line.

```bash
bee printconfig \
  --verbosity=5 \
  &> bee-config.yaml
```

This produces the following file contents, showing the default configuration of Bee:

```yaml

## Configuring Bee Installed Using a Package Manager

Bee node's installed using package managers `apt-get` or `yum` are configured using a configuration file which is automatically generated during the installation process.

To alter Bee's configuration, simply edit the configuration file as desired, and restart your Bee node using `systemctl`.

### Linux

```bash
sudo vi /etc/bee/bee.yaml     # Edit configuration file
sudo systemctl restart bee    # Restart Bee
```

### MacOS

```bash
vi /usr/local/etc/swarm-bee/bee.yaml    # Edit configuration file
brew services restart swarm-bee         # Restart Bee
```

## Configuration Options

Bee provides the following options to customise your node.

### Global

#### --config

*default* `/home/<user>/.bee.yaml`

The location of a YAML configuration file containing configuration options. See [configuration](#configuration-file).

### Start

#### --api-addr

*default* :1633

The IP and port the API will serve HTTP requests from. Omitting the IP part of the address will cause the server to listen to all interfaces. Argument values are of the form '132.132.132.132:1633'.

#### --block-time

*default* 15

The expected block time of the attached SWAP endpoint.

#### --bootnode

*default* `/dnsaddr/bootnode.ethswarm.org`

This is a [multiaddr](https://github.com/multiformats/multiaddr) specifying the Bee bootnodes used for bootstrapping the network. It can be multiple values. 

By default a node connects to the Swarm mainnet.  When using a private or test network, network specific bootnodes must be set. 

Any Bee node in a network can act as a bootnode.

#### --cache-capacity

*default* `1000000`

The amount of disk space, in chunks, that is used for forwarding and uploading chunks.

#### --clef-signer-enable             

*default* `false`

Set this to true to enable signing using Ethereum's Clef external signer. Clef is a new feature which requires a corresponding rules files or running in advanced mode to allow for auto-signing of handshakes and cheques.

#### --clef-signer-endpoint

*default* **default path for clef for each host operating system**

You may also specify a custom IPC file path for your Clef signer.

#### --clef-signer-ethereum-address

*default* **selects the clef address at index 0**

Use this command to specify which Bee Clef address is used if you have imported multiple keys into Bee Clef.

:::warning
If you have multiple addresses imported into your instance of Bee Clef, you must specify your address for each node, including the first one, as addresses may been re-ordered during import.
:::

#### --cors-allowed-origins

*default* `[]`

HTTP/WS origin domains or wildcards defining these, which the API will allow responses to, e.g.

```bash
bee start --cors-allowed-origins="*"
bee start --cors-allowed-origins="https://website.ethswarm.org"
```

#### --data-dir

*default* `/home/<user>/.bee`

The location on your disk where Bee stores its data. Data in this directory will be required to restore a node state using the same key. 

This consists of the following three types of data.


##### 1. Chunk Data (localstore)

This consists of chunks and files that you have pinned locally, cached chunks you have requested, or chunks within your radius of responsibility which you are responsible for serving to your peers.

##### 2. State Data (statestore)

This is information about the local state of your Bee node and should be backed up.

##### 3. Keystore Data (keys)

These files contain encrypted versions of your private key and should be backed up and kept private.

:::danger
Keep the key files in your keystore data directory safe! 

They are the cryptographic proof of your network identity and cannot be recovered.

*default* `false`

Corresponds to LevelDB `DisableSeeksCompaction` (see above)

#### --db-open-files-limit
*default* `200`

:::info
To accomodate less powerful hardware and operating systems, the `db-open-files-limit` is set deliberately low. We recommend that you try to increase it to nearer to `10000` or more if this is possible when using your hardware. *Please let us know how you get on with tweaking these settings on your hardware in the [#node-operators](https://discord.gg/X3ph5yGRFU) channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/wdghaQsGq5)*
:::

Corresponds to LevelDB `OpenFilesCacheCapacity` (see above)

#### --db-write-buffer-size
*default* `33554432`

Corresponds to LevelDB `WriteBuffer` (see above)

#### --debug-api-addr

*default* `:1635`

The IP and port the [Debug API](/docs/api-reference/api-reference) will serve HTTP requests from. 

Omitting the IP part of the address will cause the server to listen to all requests.

`--debug-api-enable` must be set to `true`.

#### --debug-api-enable

*default* `false`

Set this to `true` to enable access to the [Debug API](/docs/api-reference/api-reference)

#### --full-node

*default* false

Enable this by setting it to `true` to fully participate in serving and forwarding chunks to the network.

#### --gateway-mode 

*default* `false`

Set this to `true` to disable a set of sensitive features in the API to ensure that it is safe to expose your `api-addr` to the public Internet.

#### --global-pinning-enable

*default* `false`

Enables the Global Pinning functionality when set to `true`.

#### --nat-addr

*default* `""`

Sets the expected public IP. Normally this is generated automatically, but in certain circumstances it may be desirable to set it manually.

#### --network-id

*default* `1`

The network ID for which to accept new connections. Set to 1 for mainnet, 2 for testnet.

#### --p2p-addr

*default* `:1634`

The IP and port to listen for p2p protocol messages.

#### --p2p-quic-enable

*default* `false`

#### --p2p-ws-enable

*default* `false`

Enables web-sockets transport for p2p communications.

#### --password

*default* `""`

:::danger
Passing passwords as command line arguments is insecure. Use a password file or environment variable in production environments.
:::

#### --password-file

*default* `""`

The path to a file that contains password for decrypting keys. The empty string assumes no file is presented.

#### --payment-early

*default* `1000000000000`

Amount in gBZZ below the peers payment threshold which causes Bee to initiate settlement.

#### --payment-threshold

*default* `10000000000000`

ENS API endpoint for a TLD, with contract address. Multiple values can be provided. 

Settings should be provided in the format `[tld:][contract-addr@]url`

A default top level domain and resolver contract address are provided, but an ENS/Geth endpoint must be provided to enable this functionality.

#### --standalone

*default* `false`

Set this flag if we would like the node not to try to connect to the network. Useful for development.

#### --swap-enable
