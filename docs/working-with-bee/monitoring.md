Your Bee node is equipped with tools to help you understand what your Bee has been up to!

Navigate to `http://localhost:1635/metrics`. 

This is the current state of Bee's metrics as they stand in this moment.

In order to use these metrics and view, we need to keep a record of these metrics over time.

To do this we will use [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/). Simply install, configure as follows, and restart!

For Ubuntu and other Debian based Linux distributions install using `apt`.

```bash
sudo apt install prometheus
```

And configure `localhost:1635` as a `target` in the `static_configs`.

```yaml
    static_configs:
            - targets: ['localhost:9090','localhost:1635']
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) to see the Prometheus user interface.

Now that our metrics are being scraped into Prometheus' database, we can use it as a data source which is used by [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/) to display the metrics as a time series graph on the dashboard.

Type `bee_` in the 'expression' or 'metrics' field in Prometheus or Grafana respectively to see the list of metrics available. Here's a few to get you started! 

```
rate(bee_swap_cheques_received[1d])
rate(bee_swap_cheques_sent[1d])
rate(bee_swap_cheques_rejected[1d])
```
