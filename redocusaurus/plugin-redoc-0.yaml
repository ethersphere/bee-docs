        Returns a WebSocket connection on which stream of chunks can be
        uploaded. Each chunk sent is acknowledged using a binary response `0`
        which serves as confirmation of upload of single chunk. Chunks should be
        packaged as binary messages for uploading. If a tag is specified, the
        chunks will be streamed into the localstore and then uploaded to the
        network once the stream is closed. If a tag is not specified, the chunks
        will bypass the localstore and be directly uploaded to the network
        through the stream as they arrive.

      description: >-
        In order to upload a collection, user can send a multipart request with
        all the files populated in the form data with appropriate headers.

         User can also upload a tar file along with the swarm-collection header. This will upload the tar file after extracting the entire directory structure.

         If the swarm-collection header is absent, all requests (including tar files) are considered as single file uploads.

         A multipart request is treated as a collection regardless of whether the swarm-collection header is present. This means in order to serve single files uploaded as a multipart request, the swarm-index-document header should be used with the name of the file.

        Tags can be thought of as upload sessions which can be tracked using the
        tags endpoint. It will keep track of the chunks that are uploaded as
        part of the tag and will push them out to the network once a done split
        is called on the Tag. This happens internally if you use the
        `Swarm-Deferred-Upload` header.
