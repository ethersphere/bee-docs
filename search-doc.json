These latter checks do not show up on the blockchain. It's like what the bank thinks your balance is vs what your checkbook knows is actually available because of the checks you've written that are still \"in the mail\" and not yet cashed. ### What determines the number of peers and how to influence their number? Why are there sometimes 300+ peers and sometimes 30? The number of connected peers is determined by your node as it attempts to keep the distributed Kademlia well connected. As nodes come and go in the network your peer count will go up and down. If you watch bee's output logs for \"successfully connected\", there should be a mix of (inbound) and (outbound) at the end of those messages. If you only get (outbound) then you my need to get your p2p port opened through your firewall and/or forwarded by your router. Check out the connectivity section in the docs https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/installation/connectivity. ### What is the difference between \"systemctl\" and \"bee start\"? *bee start* and *systemctl start bee* actually run 2 different instances with 2 different *bee.yaml* files and two different data directories. *bee start* uses *~/.bee.yaml* and the *~/.bee* directory for data *systemctl* uses */etc/bee/bee.yaml* and (IIRC) */var/lib/bee* for data ## Swarm Protocol ### Can I use one Ethereum Address/Wallet for many nodes? No, this violates the requirements of the Swarm Protocol. The Swarm Protocol relies upon the `Swarm Address`, also known as the `peer address`. This address is a **hash of the node's Ethereum address**, therefore it is deterministic. As all nodes must have a unique address, if you were to use the same wallet, it would violate the uniqueness constraint and result in malfunctioning nodes. Therefore, the rule is, each node must have: * 1 Ethereum Address * 1 Chequebook * 3 unique ports for API / p2p / Debug API.

This approach creates a smaller, private network which many devices connect to in order to share a public IP. Traffic destined for the internet at large is then mediated by another specialised computer. In the cases of the a home network, this computer is the familiar home router, normally also used to provide a wifi network. If we run the above commands to find the computer's IP in this scenario, we will see a different output. ip address Copy en0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 ... inet 192.168.0.10 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.0.255 ... Copy Here we can see that, instead of the public IP, we can see that our computers IP is 192.168.0.10. This is part of the IP address space that the Internet Engineering Task Force has designated for private networks. As this IP won't work on the global internet, our router remembers that our computer has been assigned this IP. It then uses Network Address Translation to modify all requests from our computer to another computer somewhere in the internet. As the requests pass through the router it changes our local IP to the public IP of the router, and vice versa when the responses are sent back, from the public IP to the local one. Navigating Through the NAT# The presence of Network Address Translations presents two problems for p2p networking. The first is that it can be difficult for programs running on our computer to know our real public IP as it is not explicitly known by our computer's networking interface, which is configured with a private network IP. This is a relatively easy problem to solve as we can simply discover our public IP and then specify it in Bee's configuration, or indeed determine it using other means. The second issue is that our router has only 65535 ports to expose to the public network, however, each device on your private network is capable of exposing 65535 each. To the global internet, it appears that there is only one set of ports to connect to, whereas, in actual fact, there is a full set of ports for each of the devices which are connected to the private network. To solve this second problem, routers commonly employ an approach known as port forwarding. Bee's solution to these problems come in two flavours, automatic and manual. Automatic: Universal Plug and Play (UPNP)# UPNP is a protocol designed to simplify the administration of NAT and port forwarding by the end user by providing an API which software running within the network can use to ask the router for the external IP and to request for ports to be forwarded to the internal IP of the computer running the software. UPNP is a security risk! UPNP is a security risk as it allows any host or process inside (sometimes also outside) your network to open arbitrary ports which may be used to transfer malicious traffic, for example a RAT. UPNP can also be used to determine your IP, and in the case of using Tor or a VPN, your real public IP. be We urge you to disable UPNP on your router and use manual port forwarding as described below. Bee will use UPNP to determine your public IP, which is required for various internal processes. In addition to this, a request will be sent to your router to ask it to forward a random one of its ports, which are exposed directly to the internet, to the Bee p2p port (usually 1634) which your computer is exposing only to the private network. Doing this creates a tunnel through which other Bee's may connect to your computer safely. If you start your Bee node in a private network with UPNP available, the output of the addresses endpoint of your debug API will look something like this: [ \"/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/1634/p2p/16Uiu2HAm5zcoBFWmqjDTwGy9RXepBFF8idy6Pr312obMwwxdJSUP\", \"/ip4/192.168.0.10/tcp/1634/p2p/16Uiu2HAm5zcoBFWmqjDTwGy9RXepBFF8idy6Pr312obMwwxdJSUP\", \"/ip6/::1/tcp/1634/p2p/16Uiu2HAm5zcoBFWmqjDTwGy9RXepBFF8idy6Pr312obMwwxdJSUP\", \"/ip4/86.98.94.9/tcp/20529/p2p/16Uiu2HAm5zcoBFWmqjDTwGy9RXepBFF8idy6Pr312obMwwxdJSUP\" ] Copy Note that the port in the external multiaddress is the router's randomly selected 20529 which is forwarded by the router to 192.168.0.10:1634. Manual: Configure Your Router and Bee# Inspecting the underlay addresses in the output of the addresses endpoint our debug API, we can see addresses only for localhost 127.0.0.1 and our private network IP 192.168.0.10.

Solving our second problem is a little more difficult as we will need to interact with our router's firmware, which is a little cranky. Each router is different, but the concept is usually the same. Log in to your router by navigating your browser to your router's configuration user interface, usually at http://192.168.0.1. You will need to log in with a password. Sadly, passwords are often left to be the defaults, which can be found readily on the internet. Once logged in, find the interface to set up port forwarding. The Port Forward website provides some good information, or you may refer to your router manual or provider. Here, we will then set up a rule that forwards port 1634 of our internal IP 192.168.0.10 to the same port 1634 of our external IP. Now, when requests arrive at our external address 86.98.94.9:1634 they are modified by our router and forwarded to our internal IP and port 192.168.0.10:1634. Sometimes this can be a little tricky, so let's verify we are able to make a TCP connection using netcat. First, with Bee not running, let's set up a simple TCP listener using Netcat on the same machine we would like to run Bee on. nc -l 0.0.0.0 1634 Copy nc -zv 86.98.94.9 1634 Copy Connection to 86.98.94.9 port 1834 [tcp/*] succeeded! Copy Success! ✨ If this didn't work for you, check out our Debugging Connectivity guide below. If it did, let's start our Bee node with the --nat-addr configured. bee start --nat-addr 86.98.94.9:1634 Copy Checking our addresses endpoint again, we can now see that Bee has been able to successfully assign a public address!

Let's find out what our IP looks like to the internet. curl icanhazip.com Copy 86.98.94.9 Copy Now try to connect to your port using the global IP. nc -zv 86.98.94.9 1634 Copy If this is successful, our Bee node's path is clear! If not, we can try a few things to make sure there are no barriers stopping us from getting through. Check your computers firewall. Sometimes your computer is configured to prevent connections. If you are on a private network mediated by NAT, you can check if this is the problem by trying to connect from another device on your network using the local IP nc -zv 192.168.0.10 1634. Ubuntu uses UFW, MacOS can be configured using the Firewall tab in the Security & Privacy section of System Preferences. Windows uses Defender Firewall. For each of these firewalls, set a special rule to allow UDP and TCP traffic to pass through on port 1634. You may want to limit this traffic to the Bee application only. Check your ingress firewall. For a datacenter hired server, this configuration will often take place in somewhere in the web user interface. Refer to your server hosting provider's documentation to work out how to open ports to the open internet. Ensure that both TCP and UDP traffic are allowed. Similarly, if you are connecting from within a private network, you may find that the port is blocked by the router. Each router is different, so consult your router's firware documentation to make sure there are no firewalls in place blocking traffic on your Bee's designated p2p port. You may check this using Netcat by trying to connect using your computer's public IP, as above nc -zv 86.98.94.9 1634. Docker Docker adds another level of complexity. To debug docker connectivity issues, we may use netcat as above to check port connections are working as expected. Double check that you are exposing the right ports to your local network, either by using the command line flags or in your docker-compose.yaml. You should be able to successfully check the connection locally using eg. nc -zv localhost 1634 then follow instructions above to make sure your local network has the correct ports exposed to the internet. Something else entirely? Networking is a complex topic, but it keeps us all together. If you still can't connect to your Bee, get in touch via The Beehive and we'll do our best to get you connected. In the swarm, no Bee is left behind.

To ensure Clef only signs transactions from Bee, we must protect the clef.ipc file by creating a Bee user and setting permissions so that it is only possible for this user to make use of the ipc socket. Additionally, Clef requires transaction signatures for the Bee's chequebook interaction. A shell script automating the post-initialisation permission changing and including the Clef config, clef-service, as well as the 4byte.json transaction signature file and rules.js file can all be found in the Bee-clef repository.

To allow your Bee to use your network bandwidth and computing resources to serve the network and start cashing out cheques, set the --full-node flag to true. full-node: true Copy Blockchain Endpoints# Your Bee node must have access to the XDAI blockchain, so that it can interact with and deploy your chequebook contract. You can run yourown XDAI node or, use a provider instead - we recommendGetblock. By default, Bee expects a local XDAI node at ws://localhost:8545. To use an Ethereum RPC provider instead, change your configuration as follows. swap-endpoint: https://stake.getblock.io/mainnet/?api_key=your-api-key Copy If you would like to use your node to resolve ENS domain names, you must also provide the endpoint for an Ethereum mainnet RPC provider. resolver-options: [\"https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<<your-api-key>>\"] Copy Open File Descriptors# Bee is designed to work on a lot of different hardware configurations. To facilitate the exploration of this, during our beeta phase, we have given node operators access to leveldb's --db-open-files-limit. This helps determine the speed with which Bee can read and write to its database, and therefore its efficiency in forwarding and serving chunks. Some say setting this to much more than the default 200 leads to a much enhanced ability to participate in the swarm and get those BZZ! Share your experience in the #node-operators channel of our Discord server to help us make this process more automated in the future. db-open-files-limit: 2000 Copy "},{"title":"NAT Address","type":1,"pageTitle":"Install Bee","url":"docs/installation/install#nat-address","content":"To enable others to connect to your node, you must broadcast your public IP and ensure Bee is accessible on the right p2p port (usually 1634).

Type the following command and press enter: ls -la Copy You can think of your terminal as a very old way of interacting with your computer that was always there while you were in the graphic user interface, you just didn't know it. The terminal is home to many small programs that are designed to do one purpose very well. This is the Linux mantra. The command line is very powerful, but can be a little unwieldy and clunky at times. Once mastered, your fingers will have gained a magical control of the bits and the bytes. ls was originally written way back in 1987 but still persists today. It is still entered into terminals literally millions of times a day by thousands of engineers, hobbyists and geeks all over the world and is present in even very basic Linux distributions. Here, we have specified the l 'flag' (l is for 'long') to get the long version of the information and the h flag to get 'human readable' file sizes. Your output should looks something like this: -rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 3523 Mar 4 22:47 .bashrc -rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 10787806 Mar 23 08:18 bee_1.0.0_armv7.deb -rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 10473282 Feb 24 18:00 bee-clef_0.4.13_armv7.deb drwxr-xr-x 2 pi pi 4096 Mar 4 22:57 Bookshelf Copy For more information, you can use the man utility to read the manual. Type man ls for a full list of the options you can specify as flags. Press q to exit the man programme. Now, let's use the rm programme to remove the clutter and delete the .deb files we no longer need. rm bee_1.0.0_armv7.deb Copy The rm programme gives no output, so let's check it's dissapeared by checking the contents of the directory. This time we will also you the 'pipe' command, which passes the output of one command to the next, and the grep command which searches through the output and only prints lines that match the pattern. ls -la | grep \"bee\" Copy -rw-r--r-- 1 pi pi 10473282 Feb 24 18:00 bee-clef_0.4.13_armv7.deb Copy Success! The Bee package file is deleted! Note at the command line there is no undelete. With great power comes great resposibility. Please use your new powers wisely, and only for the good of the Swarm as a whole. ;D All that is left now is to delete the Bee package file, since we have completed this step. Type rm bee and press your tab button. Bash will autocomplete your file name. Now press enter to delete your file. Start Your Bee# If all has gone to plan, by this point your Bee will have been funded by our faucet and you should bee ready to start up your client. The dpkg package manager has used our .deb package file to install Bee and set up the the systemd programme which will manage and control our bee programme as it runs happily in the background on our computers, mining BZZ and serving and forwarding content to other bees all over the planet! We can now use the systemctl utility to interact with systemd. For more info, you can type man systemctl to read about it. Let's see what the status of your bee process is. systemctl status bee Copy You will be shown a bunch of information including the current status and the output of the logs. Press q to exit. Let's see what the current logs are saying. journalctl -u bee -f Copy Here we have used the -u flag (u is for user) to only show the output for the bee process, and f for follow, to continuously update the logs as new ones appear. Open another terminal window using the same button as before and type: systemctl restart bee Copy To restart the Bee process. You should see some activity in the logs as Bee shuts down and restarts. Now we need to specify some Bee configuration. In order to access the blockchain, your Bee needs to access an Ethereum blockchain node. We recommend running your own XDAI Node, but for now let's take the easy way and sign up to getblock.io. Once you have created an account, go to your dashboard and make a new project (you can call it whatever you'd like to). Then use the api key to create your api url as follows https://stake.getblock.io/mainnet/?api_key=your-api-key. Keep this open for later. Now we will configure your Bee node so it can access the blockchain, deploy your chequebook and start making transactions to cash out those BZZ cheques from your peers! Type: sudo nano /etc/bee/bee.yaml Copy To open the nano program which is a old time text editor, we're going to party like it's 1999. Note we're using the sudo command to wrap nano. This is short for super user do and gives us full permissions to do anything in our Raspberry Pi OS. Hold down ctrl and press w to access the where is? functionality. Type swap-endpoint and press enter. This will take you to the right part of the config file. Here we can change the value to look like the following, using your Infura url from before. Most configuration at the command line is done by changing files and then restarting processes just like this! Make sure to pay attention to detail so that everything is exact, even one misplaced character can cause issues. 🔍 ## swap ethereum blockchain endpoint (default \"http://localhost:8545\") swap-endpoint: https://stake.getblock.io/mainnet/?api_key=your-api-key Copy To save and exit, hold ctrl and press x, then y and finally enter to agree to write the file. You can see the different commands that are available listed at the bottom of the screen, for example ^X Exit. Ok! We're all set! Let's restart Bee and watch our logs as the chequebook transactions begin to be processed. systemctl restart bee Copy There are many other configuration options, check out the configuration section of the docs for more info. Now, in your other terminal window where Bee's logs are still being output, you should start to see transactions being submitted to the command line and processed, and eventually Bee will begin to connect to other Bee 'peers' in the swarm. Once you start to see messages like: successfully connected to peer 7fa40ce124d69ecf14d6f7806faaf9df5d639d339a9d343aa7004373f5c46b8f (outbound) Copy Let's do a quick check to find out how many peers we have using the curl command line utility. curl localhost:1635/peers Copy {\"peers\":[{\"address\":\"339cf2ca75f154ffb8dd13de024c4a5c5b53827b8fd21f24bec05835e0cdc2e8\"},{\"address\":\"b4e5df012cfc281e74bb517fcf87fc2c07cd787929c332fc805f8124401fabae\"} ]} Copy If you see peers listed here - congratulations!

This prevents and relieves unneccesary congestion on the blockchain. 💩 info Learn more about how SWAP and other accounting protocols work by reading The Book of Swarm . Bee contains a rich set of features to enable you to query the current accounting state of your node. First, let's query our node's current balance by sending a POST request to the balances endpoint. curl localhost:1635/chequebook/balance | jq Copy { \"totalBalance\": 10000000, \"availableBalance\": 9640360 } Copy It is also possible to examine your per-peer balances. curl localhost:1635/balances | jq Copy { \"balances\": [ //... { \"peer\": \"d0bf001e05014fa036af97f3d226bee253d2b147f540b6c2210947e5b7b409af\", \"balance\": -85420 }, { \"peer\": \"f1e2872581de18bdc68060dc8edd3aa96368eb341e915aba86b450486b105a47\", \"balance\": -75990 } //... ] } Copy In Swarm, these per-peer balances represent trustful agreements between nodes. Tokens only actually change hands when a node settles a cheque. This can either be triggered manually or when a certain threshold is reached with a peer. In this case, a settlement takes place. You may view these using the settlements endpoint. More info can be found by using the chequebook api. curl localhost:1635/chequebook/cheque | jq Copy { \"totalreceived\": 0, \"totalsent\": 718030, \"settlements\": [ //... { \"peer\": \"dce1833609db868e7611145b48224c061ea57fd14e784a278f2469f355292ca6\", \"received\": 0, \"sent\": 89550 } //... ] } Copy As our node's participation in the network increases, we will begin to see more and more of these balances arriving. In the case that we have received a settlement from another peer, we can ask our node to perform the relevant transactions on the blockchain, and cash our earnings out. To do this, we simply POST the relevant peer's address to the cashout endpoint. curl -XPOST http://localhost:1635/chequebook/cashout/d7881307e793e389642ea733451db368c4c9b9e23f188cca659c8674d183a56b Copy {\"transactionHash\":\"0xba7b500e21fc0dc0d7163c13bb5fea235d4eb769d342e9c007f51ab8512a9a82\"} Copy You may check the status of your transaction using XDAI Blockscout Finally, we can now see the status of the cashout transaction by sending a GET request to the same URL. curl http://localhost:1635/chequebook/cashout/d7881307e793e389642ea733451db368c4c9b9e23f188cca659c8674d183a56b | jq Copy { \"peer\": \"d7881307e793e389642ea733451db368c4c9b9e23f188cca659c8674d183a56b\", \"chequebook\": \"0xae315a9adf0920ba4f3353e2f011031ca701d247\", \"cumulativePayout\": 179160, \"beneficiary\": \"0x21b26864067deb88e2d5cdca512167815f2910d3\", \"transactionHash\": \"0xba7b500e21fc0dc0d7163c13bb5fea235d4eb769d342e9c007f51ab8512a9a82\", \"result\": { \"recipient\": \"0x312fe7fde9e0768337c9b3e3462189ea6f9f9066\", \"lastPayout\": 179160, \"bounced\": false } } Copy Success, we earned our first BZZ! 🐝 Now we have earnt tokens, to withdraw our BZZ from the chequebook contract back into our node's own wallet, we simply POST a request to the chequebook withdraw endpoint. curl -XPOST http://localhost:1635/chequebook/withdraw\\?amount\\=1000 | jq Copy And conversely, if we have used more services than we have provided, we may deposit extra BZZ into the chequebook contract by sending a POST request to the deposit endpoint. curl -XPOST http://localhost:1635/chequebook/deposit\\?amount\\=1000 | jq Copy {\"transactionHash\":\"0x60fd4be6c1db4552ecb5cd3c99f6a4906089277f592593cccd1fee0dbf501085\"} Copy You may then use Blockscout to track your transaction and make sure it completes successfully. Managing uncashed cheques# For the Bee process, the final step of earning BZZ is cashing a cheque. It is worth noting that a cheque is not yet actual BZZs. In Bee, a cheque, just like a real cheque, is a promise to hand over money upon request. In real life, you would present the cheque to a bank. In swarm life, we present the cheque to a smart-contract. Holding on to a swap-cheque is risky; it is possible that the owner of the chequebook has issued cheques worth more BZZ than is contained in their chequebook contract. For this reason, it is important to cash out your cheques every so often. With the set of API endpoints, as offered by Bee, it is possible to develop a script that fully manages the uncashed cheques for you. As an example, we offer you a very basic script, where you can manually cash out all cheques with a worth above a certain value.
